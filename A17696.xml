         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are to proceed in the hiſtorie which yeſterday we began with all concerning <hi>Lots</hi> deliuerance. And firſt wee may behold the great goodnes &amp; fauour of God towards <hi>Abram,</hi> in giuing him the meane
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13060:6"/>for the reſcuing of him. And mark why <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> eſpecially ſaith <hi>(That one which had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, came vnto Abram the Hebrewe)</hi> True it is, that this word is not ſpoken by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: For the Tribe of <hi>Eber</hi> was there ſo called: And <hi>Eber,</hi> was deſcended of <hi>Sem</hi> (as heretofore wee haue declared) ſo that now God had ſeperated <hi>Abram</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that he ſhould not be tainted or polluted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Cananites. Neuertheles how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is, <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue him this title, as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, Thou art but a ſtraunger &amp; a new come ghueſt in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And beſides, no maruell though there was no account made of him, ſith he had neither kinsfolkes nor yet friendes there. And yet for all that, God graunted him ſuch fauour and priuiledge, as that when time and place ſerued, hee was aduertiſed of the euill that was betide his Nephew that he might helpe to reſcue him. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth, that hee was in league with ſome of his neighbours. And yet we ſee that he was not long before driuen to wander from place to place, this way and that, by reaſon he was euery where diſcurteouſly entreated: for where euer hee came, he was ſtill driuen to the worſt. In ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deed, God had commanded him to tread ouer the land far and neere, to trie him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, he was before that driuen of neceſsitie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13060:6"/>to do it. Now there is no doubt but that his vertues had gotten him ſuch credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as that hee was accepted amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea euen the chiefeſt men of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made account of him as of their friend, and allianced with him to ioine togither one with another. And yet this is certaine, that al the vertues in the world cannot ſomtimes afford a man any ſuch good turne: except theſe two things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre togither with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The one is, that they which behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues iuſtly &amp; ſoundly: will firſt conforme their liues according to the preſcript rule of the word of God, and ſo long as they ſerue God, they will alſo ſhew an humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto their neighbours, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vnto themſelues many times, peace, and ſtaie the mallice of thoſe which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be readie to grieue &amp; vex them. And in verie deed,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.20.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in handling of this argument, when as hee exhorteth, ſeruants to well doing, and to ſerue thoſe whome they are bounde to ſerue, ſaith: That they may thereby obtaine ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as not to be ſtriken nor hardly dealt withall. Howbeeit (ſaith hee) how euer it is, <hi>If you endure griefe, and ſuffer wrong for well doing, and yet by the testimonie of your owne conſciences, ye take it patiently, then are you worthie of thankes before God.</hi> And this is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13060:7"/>it that we are here in this place to note. Now the ſecond is, That God bleſſeth all thoſe which ſo iuſtly walke, and mollifieth the hearts of men towards them. When then we heare it here ſaid, That <hi>Abram</hi> had ſome to ioyne with him, no doubt of it, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee ſeene, that they were ſuch as before time no whitliked of him, or els ſuch kinde of men as ſought to liue riotouſly and vpon the ſpoile: for in verie deed ſuch men were inclinable inough to ioyne with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, to ſaie the truth, this alliance of theirs was to continue but onely for a time. For it is certaine, that <hi>Abram</hi> would neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with thoſe whome God had alreadie condemned, although he ſtaied their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and it had been alſo contrarie to the promiſe. And therefore <hi>Abram</hi> ſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vpon a ſure ground, becauſe he would not leſſen the bleſsing promiſed vnto him. Neuertheles, how euer it was, yet did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer refuſe to allye himſelfe with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might therby haue been peaceably, and not bee as it were a praie and ſpoile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, whereby we are admoniſhed, as I haue alreadie ſaid, ſo to conuerſe with men, yea although they ſhould be as it were ſharpe prickes to pricke vs, deſpitefully to entreat vs, and maliciouſly and hardly to deale with vs, yet ſhould we yeeld vnto it,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13060:7"/>becauſe they might perceiue that we deſired nothing but peace, &amp; the procuring of their welfare. And although they went about by all meanes poſsible to hurt, and iniuriouſly handle vs: yet notwithſtanding ſhould wee ſtil reſt in this hope, that God would change their curſed and venimous hearts, or els ſo bridle them, as that although wee were as ſheep amongſt a ſort of rauening wolues, yet that wee ſhall bee garded and warranted by the hand of this heauenly ſhepheard. Thus we ſee what wee are hereby to learne. Now the cauſe of the warre is eftſoones ſet down vnto vs, in that <hi>Abram</hi> ſeeing his kinſman taken priſoner, tooke armes vpon him. They had long before that, giuen him many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to fall out with them: and yet all the damage they had done him, and all the loſſe that hee had receiued at their handes, could neuer induce him to make warre. Hee beare all thoſe things patiently: but the only cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of his Nephew moued him therunto. Here a queſtion might be asked, whether it was lawfull for <hi>Abram</hi> to take Armes vpon him yea or no: for although (as wee ſay in common prouerbe) that blood cannot lye, and that he might haue ſuch an affection to recouer his Nephew, as that it could not be imputed to him as a fault: yet neuertheles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e muſt hold this for a generall rule: That
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13060:8"/>it is not lawfull for any man whatſoeuer, to take Armes vpon him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ro.</hi> 13.4.</note> For it is God alone that muſt do that. It is hee (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) which armeth Kings &amp; Princes. And when hee ſaith, <hi>That it is they that haue the right and ſuperioritie to puniſh the wicked,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Behold why they carrie the ſword,</hi> It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould vſurpe it at their pleaſure, and do with it as it pleaſeth other men. God then muſt bee the Authour thereof. Thus you ſee why I haue ſaid, that no man may vſe force and violence, without he receiue the ſame from him to whome it belongeth. And therefore there are none but Kinges, Princes, and Magiſtrates, that may take Armes vpon them, and with whome men may ioyne themſelues. And this is a point vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we muſt ſurely ground our ſelues and ſtand vpon: For, what a thing were it for euerie man to take the fieldes when anie wrong were done him. Without doubt that were to bring an horrible confuſion euerie where. Moreouer, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to keepe vs within compaſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.19</note> and to exhort vs vnto pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, alledgeth that ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Canticle,<note place="margin">Deu. 32.35.</note> 
               <hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord. Whereupon he concludeth, that wee muſt giue place to wrath and anger. God taketh this office of reuenge vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if there be any extremitie and wrong
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13060:8"/>committed, becauſe it is his office to puniſh the ſame: now then, if euery man ſhall take this vpon him, and that euery priuate man ſhall thruſt himſelfe in, to be reuenged, no doubt of it that man robbeth God of his honour and right, as if hee would exclude him quite and cleane out of all. To the end then that we giue place vnto ire: that is to ſay, if wee will haue God to ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee our protectour and defender, and bee aduenged of our enemies, and take our warres in hand, wee ought all bee quiet and peaceable. For, he that ſhall arme himſelfe, robbeth God as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaide, of the iuriſdiction which hee giueth to himſelfe for the defenſe of his. To be ſhort, priuate perſons ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ro abſtaine from all kinde or violence, but alſo are to haue a quiet and peaceable minde to ſuffer, when ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to humble them. And in the meane while,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.19.</note> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth vs) wee are to recommend both our ſoules and liues to him, who is both the protector and owner of them. And yet neuertheles we ſee here how <hi>Abram</hi> was approoued (for <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in bleſsing him ſaith, That the victorie which God had giuen him was guided by him) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh he was but a priuat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king nor prince: but dwelt in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of

               <hi>Canaan</hi> as a ſtraunger. Howbeit, heere is one thing firſt of all to be noted of vs, that hee had been alreadie conſtituted and ordeined to be Lord and maiſter of this countrie. And although the poſſeſsion thereof was not as yet giuen him, yet for all that, the right and title thereof belonged vnto him. For God had pronounced it by his owne mouth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Behold this land is thine and to thy poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deu. 12.7 &amp; 13.15.</note> And therefore <hi>Abram</hi> is not to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as of the reſt, ſeeing that God himſelfe had teſtified vnto him that he gaue him the poſſeſsion of this land, although he preſently enioyed it not. Now then we muſt looke into the difference that is betweene <hi>Abram</hi> and others. For if any man ſhall reply and ſay, that it is not inough that hee was the right owner of it in ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time: yet are we hereupon to note: That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which we here read, is like vnto the example of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 2.12.</note> For, when as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlue the Egyptian, yet was not the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the people as then come. For it was fortie yeares after: &amp; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Moſes</hi> forbeare not to execute with the ſword: neither can it be ſaid that it was raſhly and fooliſhly done, becauſe God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the fact.<note place="margin">Act. 7.25.</note> And S. <hi>Stephen</hi> namely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth, That <hi>Moſes</hi> thought that his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had knowne that God had ordeined him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13060:10"/>thereunto, and had appointed him that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> thereby declared that he thruſt not in himſelfe into that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as of himſelfe. And in verie deed,<note place="margin">Exo. 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. and 13. Exo. 4.1. Ex. 10.13.</note> fortie yeares after when God called him, hee diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, &amp; vſed al the reaſons &amp; ſhifts that poſsibly he could to auoid himſelfe out of that Commiſsion. Wherein hee ſhewed that he had not done that act vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardines: And God himſelfe alſo therein declared, that he had reſerued his ſeruant, in making him commit that act alone, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him afterward when time ſhould ſerue, in matters of greater importance. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God might for once, giue leaue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie vnto his ſeruant <hi>Abram,</hi> to exerciſe the force of the ſword, although he was not as yet put in poſſeſsion of the land which he had promiſed him. And beſides, we are alſo to note, that God giueth oftentimes ſingular motions vnto his ſeruants, which wee muſt not draw vnto our ſelues to follow. Wherof we haue a moſt excellent glaſſe to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the booke of the Iudges: for, whereas that booke ſpeaketh of certaine men whom God had ſtirred vp to aide his people, the ſame are ſo many teſtimonies vnto vs, to ſhew that we ſhould not thinke, that there is alwaies an aſſured &amp; certaine election, when any one man ſhuld be armed, with the ſword
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13060:11"/>and with authoritie. Did <hi>Gedeon</hi> know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that hee was choſen? no ſurely he did not. Neither yet <hi>Sampſon</hi> nor any of the reſt. I ſhall not need to recite three or foure of them: for as I haue already ſaid, as many as there are ſpoken of, were choſen of God, and yet they themſelues knew it not. We ſee how <hi>Gedeon</hi> doubted &amp; was in great perplexitie: and therfore wold haue God giue him a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token of his vocation &amp; calling: and a man would haue thought, that when he had obteined the thing which he craued, that it ſhould haue redoubled his courage: and yet it fell not ſo out with him. For we ſee that he was very timerous. And yet God had ſo choſen &amp; appointed him for the deliuerance of the people, as that with 300. men he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited a great number, yea euen a great &amp; mighty army. And yet all that which is here recited vnto vs, is not for vs to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule thereof. For it were a mockerie and a fooliſh argument for vs thus to reaſon. See how God hath redeemed his Church from the tyrannie of the wicked and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles, by the handes of <hi>Iepththe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 11.33. Iudg. 13.14.15.16. and 7.</note> 
               <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Gedeon,</hi> and ſuch like. And therefore when wee ſee the children of God vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed, that it ſhall bee lawfull for vs to take Armes vppon vs to aide them: Now, this were too too horned an argument.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13060:11"/>For it were meete that wee ſhould haue the ſpirit of thoſe whome we pretend to haue, that is to ſaie, That wee ſhould bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that God hath alſo called vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And why? becauſe as I haue alreadie ſaide, they had their particular motions, as if they had beene priuiledged thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by a publicke lawe. And wee are in all thinges to note, that when God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth extraordinarily, being grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his word, that priuiledge is not of vs to bee vſurped. For it is the Office of a King or Councell, to graunt a priuiledge to anie, neyther is it for mee to knowe the reaſon why hee doth ſo: for if I ſhall doo the lyke that hee doeth which is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged: I ſhall ioyne my ſelfe with him that would ſeperate himſelfe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon order. For wee muſt leaue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Kings and Magiſtrates to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they know to bee beſt for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale: and it is great reaſon wee ſhould do ſo. And therefore ſo often as we ſhall ſee God minded to remember the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and deliueraunce of his Church by ſuch as he hath ordeined to be as it were miniſters of his own preparing, we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, theſe to be ſingular acts paſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; thoſe men to be choſen by him: and armed alſo by his authority and power,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13060:12"/>But to ſay, that euerie man may take vppon him to do as much, the ſame would bring, as I haue already ſaid, horrible confuſion. Thus we ſee what we haue to learne as concerning that matter which is here recited vnto vs of <hi>Abram.</hi> To wit, that God had alreadie giuen him a token, that he had not in vaine conſtituted him lord &amp; maiſter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And beſides, he gaue him alſo a litle taſte that his ſucceſſours ſhould enter the land: and that whatſoeuer forces ſhould come againſt them, yet that they ſhould no way let them from conquering the whole land. And although the Army of thoſe kings of whom we yeſterday ſpake, was not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thirtie or fortie thouſand, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <hi>Abram</hi> had onlye but thoſe of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, which were but 300. and 18. men. Now for any man to ſay that they were experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſouldiers, were a verie mockerie: becauſe <hi>Abram</hi> was neuer brought vp in the warres, he knew not which way to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle either ſword or Target. And it is ſo far of for him to be the more confident &amp; bold by reaſon of thoſe confederates that came with him, as that it was an occaſion to make him the more afraid. For they might haue alledged and ſaid thus, Why this ſame ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger goeth about to haue all our throtes cut. For do we not here ſee four victorious kings
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13060:12"/>which haue ſpoiled <hi>Sodome</hi> &amp; <hi>Ghomorre,</hi> and all their neighbour Cities about them, and ſhall we thinke to do any good to ſet vpon them? ſurely in ſo doing, we ſhall as it were caſt our ſelues wittingly and willingly away. And therefore <hi>Abram</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus diſtreſſed, ſhould in the common opinion of man, rather deſiſt and liue in peace. Now at the firſt ſight, it ſhould ſeeme to be a great folly for him to take the war vpon him with CCC. and xviii. men, and himſelfe being a ſilly old man, become their Captain: he that neuer knew what either warre or battaile meant, as we haue alreadie ſaid, &amp; yet wold hazard the caſting of himſelfe away ſo fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore we are the more earneſtly to obſerue that which I haue alreadie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: to wit, that God would thereby ſhew him, that when he entended to put his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in poſſeſsion of the land, that it was an eaſie matter for him to do it, by reaſon of that noble victory which he had giuen him, a thing not to haue been belieued, if a man would haue iudged therof according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon. Here we ſee in ſumme, what we are to learne as touching this point where it is ſaid, <hi>That Abram armed his houſhold me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> We ſee by this, with what wiſdome God endued him, although hee had neuer been trained in the wars, neither yet acquainted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13060:13"/>with any ſtratagemmes or warlike pollicies, whatſoeuer: and yet notwithſtanding we ſee that he ſurprized his enimies, charging them ſodeinly in the night, yea euen then when they thought themſelues moſt ſafe and ſure being throughly fraught with good meats &amp; ſtrong drinks: and ſolacing themſelues with the ioy of the ſpoile of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Ghomorre.</hi> Now we know that after ſuch victories there is much ryot and filthines committed. And yet <hi>Abram</hi> had ſo much cunning as to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize his enimies: although in very deed, the former victories which his enimies had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, had bin inough greatly to haue dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. And againe, his ſo ſodein and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die comming muſt needes bring with it a great to doo and tumult: had not God by his holie ſpirite gouerned the ſame. By this wee are to vnderſtand, that GOD would needes take this matter in hand by him: and not onely for <hi>Lots</hi> ſake, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe hee ſhould know, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſe of GOD was neither vaine nor fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous, when as hee had giuen him the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and ſuperioritie ouer the whole lande of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And this is that in ſumme which hereby we are to learne.</p>
            <p>It followeth after (that the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> came vnto him) which is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the great fauour and grace that God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13060:13"/>beare vnto <hi>Abram.</hi> For, wee haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alledged the ſaying of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 16.49.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Sodomites were extreem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proude,</hi> which was the verie ſpring head of all the enormities that prouoked the vengeance of God, vtterly to roote them out. Now how proude ſoeuer the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> was, yet was hee glad to come and doo homage to <hi>Abram,</hi> becauſe hee knew that both his life and all his Country were due to him.</p>
            <p>Heereby then wee ſee, that it was God whiche had the direction in this matter, and bleſſed his ſeruaunt <hi>Abram.</hi> True it is, that it had been much better for him not to haue gone out of his Tent to the hazardyng of him ſelfe ſo daungerouſlie: But it was GOD that ſtretched out his hand vnto him, becauſe he would haue him knowe by experience, his power and aide in the matter. This conſequently, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie profited <hi>Abram:</hi> For if hee had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his houſe without vnderſtandyng the lyke defenſe of GOD, without all doubt hee had neuer beene ſo rightlye confirmed as afterwad he was. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſee, that when GOD ſendeth vs anye afflictions, although at the firſt they bee neuer ſo harde and greeuous, yet for all that, in the ende, the iſſue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13060:14"/>of them is profitable and beneficiall to our good.<note place="margin">Ro. 1.2.4. Eſai. 49.24.</note> For, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Patience engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth triall.</hi> To the end we might effectually know, that it is God which hath ſuccoured vs: and when we once know that, we might more &amp; more be confirmed to truſt in him. <hi>And hope neuer maketh vs aſhamed:</hi> for, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall haue recourſe to God, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be confounded. And therefore wee ſee, that we can neuer reſt quiet and bee peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, vntil ſuch time as God ſheweth vs why he hath afflicted vs, and that in the meane while, he maketh vs to feele that it is for our good, and ſo conſequently we haue occaſion to bleſſe him, and call vpon him more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly. Thus we ſee what we are here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue as concerning this point. Now where it is ſaid, that the king of <hi>Sodome</hi> came vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,</hi> hee addeth anon after, (that <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech king of Shalem,</hi> offered alſo bread and wine.) And for as much as hee was the high Prieſt of God, that he bleſſed <hi>Abram:</hi> and that <hi>Abram</hi> gaue him the tythe of all the ſpoile. Here we ſee as notable an hiſtorie as anie is in all the holie ſcripture, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an hiſtorie, but ſuch a one alſo as is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly image to repreſent our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as in the 110. Pſalme it is written. For, it is not without cauſe there ſet downe, <hi>That God had ſworne and would not repent him thereof,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13060:14"/>that he wold neuer breake the ſolemne oth which he had made.</hi> That is to ſaie, <hi>That Ieſus Christ is a Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi> If there were nothing els but the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof, we ſee that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God his Prieſt: howbeit how euer it is, yet is he moſt like in eſtate and degree vnto <hi>Abram,</hi> but wanteth a great peece of it. For, as wee ſhall heare after, <hi>Abram</hi> is called the father of all the faithfull and of the whole Church, and that all ſuch as are the children of God, muſt be his ſpirituall children. And therefore <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in one reſpect muſt needes bee his inferiour. It is farre from the meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to preferre him before <hi>Abram,</hi> as the Apoſtle verie rightly doth,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.4.5.6.7.</note> as hereafter we ſhall ſee. Some haue thought this to be <hi>Sem:</hi> but there is no likelihood of anie truth therin. For if it had been ſo, would <hi>Abram</hi> haue tarried ſo long before hee had ſeene the Patriarch <hi>Sem,</hi> of whome hee was deſcended? No doubt of it he would at the firſt haue gone vnto him, &amp; haue dwelt with him: for he was king of <hi>Salem.</hi> And in verie deed, <hi>Abram</hi> might very well haue ſheelded himſelfe vnder his protection, but bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all the country ouer: and all that while there was no mention made of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Moreouer, it was not without good cauſe noted of the Apoſtle, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> had neither father nor mother without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13060:15"/>&amp; without end, as if he had bin an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall man immediatly deſcended from heuen, not but that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a man: but the Apoſtle his meaning is to ſhew, that he is brought in as though he had neuer bin borne. For, no man knoweth who was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet who was his mother: no man knoweth his kindred nor yet how he liued: and beſides, no man knoweth where hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and yet he is a prieſt of the liuing God. Neuertheles, he manifeſtly ſhewed himſelf, and eftſoones hid himſelfe, and was buried, but no man knoweth how nor when. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle ſheweth, that hee was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who although he be the euerlaſting ſonne of God, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he had no father after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner of men, becauſe his diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſpirituall and eternall: and was alſo miraculouſly conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, beyond the order of nature. And although hee be dead, yet he liueth for euer: yea and hath obteined life for vs, in that he died for vs. And therfore he is without beginning &amp; without end: without beginning, becauſe he is God eternall: and without end, becauſe we liue for euer in him, as it is ſaid by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, Who ſhall tel the line that ſhal come of him?</hi> The Church, by the vertue &amp; power of our lord Ieſus Chriſt is immortal:<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 53.8.</note> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a far ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger reaſon, muſt he needs be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13060:15"/>without end. But we wil hereafter ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle this more at large, &amp; at this time briefly runs it ouer, to ſhew that it was not <hi>Sem.</hi> See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo eſpecially counteth the redeemer that ſhuld come, vnto <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, before we go any farther, wee are to note, that it was a wonderfull grace of God, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> could ſo purely keep himſelfe, conſidering that al the land at that time, was ful of idolatry: for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> his fathers houſe was a den of idols, as heretofore we haue ſaid, &amp; as the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth vnto vs by the mouth of <hi>Ioſua.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſua 24.2.</note> Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that al was ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the land of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nigh vnto the place wher <hi>Noe</hi> dwelt, wher he had continually liued, that <hi>Sem</hi> &amp; ſuch as he was were there alſo: ſeeing then that the diuel had peruerted and ſo fowly defiled the ſeruice of God, how is it poſsible that in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where the people are wicked, where there is nothing but impiety, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of god, &amp; rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where there is nothing but iniquitie, deceit, cruelty &amp; violence, that yet there ſhould dwel a prieſt of the liuing God? By this we may ſee how God ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times hath his church, as a man wold ſay, raked vp in the aſhes, and in the iudgement of men not to be ſeene: but it ſufficeth that God knoweth it. Wherof wee haue heere a teſtimony in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech.</hi> A man would haue thought that there had not beene at that time one man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13060:16"/>that worſhipped God ſincerely and ſimplie: For, ſeeing that the graundfather of <hi>Abram</hi> and all his kindred were giuen to diuelliſh errors, and ſerued Idols, what muſt we think of the reſt? A man would haue then iudged that the Church of God had been vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed: but we may ſee, that he had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a litle ſeed thereof, when as his will was, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſhould bee a Prieſt there, yea euen in ſuch a land as more exceeded in all iniquitie then any of the reſt. Let vs then apply this to our owne vſe: for, this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptation for vs to think that God hath no church in the world: for then it muſt fall out, that his promiſe is vaine &amp; of none effect. And beſides, when a man thinketh himſelfe to be left alone, hee becommeth ſo careles and negligent, as that he falleth into diſpaire: as wee ſee how neerely <hi>Elye</hi> was drawne into it when as he ſaid, what ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this geare? For, they haue killed thy Prophets,<note place="margin">1. Kings 19.10.</note> haue ſet vp their Idols in euerie place, and my ſelfe am left alone. He was as it were like a poore diſmaid man, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to caſt himſelfe headlong into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles pit of diſpaire. But what? God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him and ſaid vnto him,<note place="margin">1. Kings 19.18.</note> 
               <hi>That hee had as yet reſerued vnto himſelfe ſeuen thouſand,</hi> that is to ſaie, a great number, <hi>that had not bowed their knee vnto Baul.</hi> So then, as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaid, our faith ſhould bee maruellouſly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13060:16"/>ſhaken, yea vtterly ouerthrowne; If we ſhuld be perſuaded of this, that God had ſo forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the world, as that he had no Church left in it. And therefore let vs learne, not to iudge by the outward ſight of the eye, whether there be a Church, or no: but let vs rather reuounce our owne inſight: becauſe wee are aduertiſed, that God will many times haue a litle ſeed of it lie hidden: as the graines of corne are not ſeene ſo long as there lieth a great heape of ſtrawe vppon it, becauſe the graines are ſmall and few which are couered with it. Euen ſo it ſeemeth ſometimes, that all the faithfull ſeruants of God, are heere quite and cleane rooted out from the face of the earth: howbeit, the Lord hath incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible means for the vpholding of his: and hee muſt needs be continually worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſerued, not that he doth looke for a great, glorious, and pompous multitude in his Church: but it may ſuffice vs that hee knoweth who are his. And ſo let vs depart from all iniquitie, that we might call aloude vpon his name, &amp; ioyne our ſelues with our brethren, although wee know them not: For that dependeth vppon God his adoption, when as hee witneſſeth vnto vs by his holie ſpirit, that hee hath a great number of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones, neither is it needfull that we know them. Wherefore it is his will and pleaſure that they ſhuld be diſperſed throughout the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13060:17"/>face of the whole earth, &amp; haue no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before men: but be contemtable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed perſons, and to be ſhort, to be no more knowne &amp; eſteemed of, then if they laie tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s feet. And thus much for this: &amp; yet wee are to gather from this place ſome exhortation, which is, not to folow the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. For, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> might haue fallen to idolatry as wel as the reſt, if he had had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that which they did: for, there was nothing all there about, but a very polution of the ſeruice of God, &amp; yet he continued in that which he knew to be good &amp; iuſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which God had inſtructed him in. Neither was ther any law at that time wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: but God had giuen him ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as wel by <hi>Noe,</hi> as by <hi>Sem,</hi> as was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation. Now if ſo ſmal an inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> had, conſtantly eſtabliſhed him in pure religion, how ſhall we be able to excuſe our ſelues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as god daily repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe vnto our eares, that he hath ſet downe a law which ſheweth vs how he wil be worſhipped &amp; ſerued, hath giuen vs prophets to explane it vnto vs, and hath giuen vs alſo a ghoſpel, which is a trumpet to ſound not only into our eares, but alſo throughly to pearce both our thoughts &amp; affections? when God then hath ſo many meanes to keep vs within compaſſe to ſerue him purely &amp; ſincerely, if we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decline from the ſame, &amp; be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13060:17"/>away by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vnder a colour that we ſee ſuch a cuſtome beare ſway, that ſuch an abuſe ruleth &amp; reigneth, &amp; is receiued &amp; accepted, and that we dwel &amp; liue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt infidels and idolaters: what a condemnation ſhall that be vnto vs, ſeeing that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; firmely perſiſted &amp; ſtood ſoundly in his faith &amp; beliefe? Let vs therefore lift vp our eies vnto God, haue our eares fixed as it were vnto his word, &amp; all our ſenſes attentiue, that we be neuer carried away, although we ſhuld be toſſed vp &amp; downe here below as it were in the ſea, &amp; driuen too and fto with windes and tempeſts: and that if there were a people that ſhould hold a religion, &amp; that there ſhould be ſome great king that would haue them, thus &amp; thus to gouern themſelues, yet let vs learne to hold vs alwaies vnto our God alone, &amp; that it is inogh for vs, to bewar that we neuer decline from the way which he hath ſhewed vnto vs by his word: &amp; that the bright ſhining light of the law &amp; the ghoſpell be euer before vs, &amp; that we ſhal neuer erre, ſo long as we know God to be our guide &amp; leader. Thus wee ſee what wee are to learne from the example of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Let vs now come to the text of <hi>Moſes:</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> king of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> offered bread and wine, and was a prieſt of the liuing God, and bleſſed <hi>Abram.</hi> It is meete that this text bee reſolued: <hi>That Melceiſedech, inaſmuch as he was a king, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13060:18"/>Abram, and gaue vnto him bread and wine for the refreſhing of his people: and being by qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, a Prieſt, bleſsed him, and that Abram alſo gaue him the tythe of all the ſpoile.</hi> Here we ſee, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> is ſet before vs both a King and a Prieſt. Now here wee are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, of the diuers actes, by the ſeuerall offices. For as I haue already ſaid, in as much as he was a King, he dealt liberally with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram:</hi> hee refreſhed him and all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and for as much as hee was a Prieſt, hee bleſſed <hi>Abram.</hi> Now, it was a common thing amongſt the auncient Fathers, for euery king to be a prieſt: and the very prophane people do ſhew, that that was vſed in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. For, Kings were not contented with their kingly eſtate, but deſired alſo through ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Prieſts, becauſe they thought it to be a more holie dignitie, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of a King. And thus wee ſee why they would oftentimes be Prieſts. And in verie deed we ſee, that that was a moſt ambitious deſire, and that they which coueted credite and eſtimation, would alwaies aſpire and clime that way: but how euer it is, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that <hi>Moſes</hi> reciteth this as a ſingular thing in <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Neuertheles we ſee, that God hath in his law made a difference betweene the one and the other, and wil not haue them both to reſt in one perſon. And <hi>Moſes</hi> was as excellent a man in all perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <note place="margin">F.x. 28.1.</note>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:13060:18"/>of vertues as euer was born in the world: and yet wold not God for all that, haue him to be a Prieſt alſo, but would haue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aaron</hi> to take vpon him the office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had inough to do with the ciuill gouernment that was laid vpon him. And in very deed we ſee how <hi>Oſias</hi> was puniſhed:<note place="margin">2. Chron. 26.21.</note> for, being a king, hee was arrogantly puffed vp, to take vpon him the vſurpation of the prieſthood: and for onely ſenſing vppon the Aultar with frankenſence, hee was ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a leproſie, put to great ſhame, and made a recluſe all the daies of his life. And yet for all that, it ſeemed that his deuotion was good, or at leaſt, that he was to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yea but god did not puniſh the outward act only: for he knew well inough the pride of king <hi>Oſias</hi> heart. And beſides, it is ſaid, <hi>That obedience is better then all the ſacrifices in the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.22.</note> And becauſe he thruſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an office which God expreſly forbad, and troubled the vocation &amp; order which ſhuld haue been inuiolably kept, vve ſee wherfore he is puniſhed. And for ſo much as he would not content himſelfe with his eſtate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, therefore it was meet that hee ſhould be made infamous and deteſtable, and bee quite and cleane ſeperated from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men. Thus we ſee that in the law were two things which were not tollerated to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13060:19"/>in one man, to wit, kingdom and prieſthood. And therefore ſeeing it is ſo, wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this example which is heere ſet downe is abſolute ſingular, and apperteineth not vnto the law. True it is, that at that time, the lawe was not as then written, and the Tribe of <hi>Leuie</hi> was not yet in the world, to take vppon it the right of the prieſtly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: howbeit this example is here ſet downe vnto vs for inſtruction, to the end the lawe might remaine in her full ſtrength, and the Church thereby might bee edified, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Pſalme by mee alledged. And therefore wee muſt conclude,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> that it was not ſpoken of <hi>Salomon,</hi> nor yet of any other king deſcended from the Stemme of <hi>Dauid:</hi> For, if they were kings, they muſt not haue entermedled themſelues with the prieſthood, for if they did, they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. Wherefore, when it is ſaid, that there ſhould bee a king a figure of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and according to his order and eſtate: that ſheweth that it was not ſpoken of the whole race of <hi>Dauid,</hi> vvhich vvas deſcended of him according to the fleſh, ſauing vntill ſuch time as vve come vnto the high prieſt our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. True it is, that hee is the ſonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> and of his ſeed. But there is in him an eſpeciall yea an onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to bee had: vvhich is, that hee made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13060:19"/>an end of the prieſthood of the lavv, becauſe his kingdome is ſpirituall: and that is it alſo, that ſhall make an end of this earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, vvhich vvas eſtabliſhed but for a time, and that vntill his comming. Novv, vvhen it is called perpetuall: the meaning is, that hee hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in the perſon of the redeemer. And therfore this is it that we are to obſerue out of theſe vvords of <hi>Moſes,</hi> vvhen he ſaith, That <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> vvas king of <hi>Salem,</hi> and that hee vvas vvithall a prieſt. We ſee then, that theſe tvvo offices belong to none but vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: according to that rule vvhich God hath ſet dovvne in his lavv: and therefore vve are out of all doubt that it vvas the prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt vvhich vvas ſhevved vnto <hi>Abram:</hi> to the end his faith by that meanes might be ſealed and the better confirmed. For, ſith the bodie vvas not ſeene, it behoued that there ſhould be ſome ſhadovves at the leaſt thereof. And therefore had the fathers the ſhadovves of it for the vpholding of their faith, ſtil looking for the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt. They had (I ſay) ſhadovves and figures. And although that, be not to vs common vvith them: yet is it verie profitable for vs. For, vve are to gather, that Ieſus Chriſt vvas not ſent in haſt vnto vs, neither yet that God determined in a minute of time to ſend him vnto vs for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13060:20"/>our redeemer: for he was already the verie true redeemer, although he had not as yet taken vpon him our nature, nor yet manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, neither yet the goſpel publiſhed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we ſee, that the faith which we haue at this day extendeth it ſelfe farre and wide. And the Goſpel hath been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: in ſuch ſort as that the ancient Fathers were built vqpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that in him was their hope and ſaluation: to be ſhort, that is an helpe which is not to be contemned. But when we ſhall compare the ſhadowes with the bodie, we ſhall ſee that our redemption is more to be wiſhed, then the ſtate of the Fathers. And therefore we ſee, why it is ſaid, <hi>That bleſsed are the eyes which ſaw that, that the Diſciples had ſeene: for manie kings and prophets had an earneſt deſire to enjoy ſuch a fight,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.18.</note> 
               <hi>and will put my confidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Now then, when we ſhall make ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, wee haue wherewithall mightily to be ſtrengthened, and to be angry at whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the diuel may thruſt in, to withdraw vs from the puritie of the Goſpell: and bee ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13060:20"/>much the more ſtirred vp to embrace our lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeing that he hath brought the full and perfect truth of that which was figured in the law. Thus we ſee how wee are to benefite our ſelues by this place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As touching <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> his dwelling place, it is moſt like to be true that it was <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> how beit, there hath bin a compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded word <hi>Iebuſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> by reaſon of the Iebuſites that occupied that place there. How euer it is, that was the Citie wherein <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> had been, and there alſo where Ieſus Chriſt exerciſed his office of prieſthood, not onely when he preached the Goſpell, but alſo when he was crucified for vs, and offered vp an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblation vnto God his father, to reconcile vs vnto him for euer, and to clenſe vs of all our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Let vs now proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtic of our good God, in acknowledging our offences: beſeeching him to receiue vs to his mercy.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue already begun to declare, that <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here made, was a figure of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. And to the ende wee might the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely hearken vnto this doctrine, wee are to remember that, which yeſterday was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, that is, that God ſware by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath, That he that ſhould be king; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the people, ſhould alſo be a Prieſt. Now it is certaine, that God is verie ſparing and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13060:22"/>carefull of his name; and caſteth it not out at all aduentures: for his meaning is, that wee ſhould haue it in all reuerend regard, &amp; not take it but vpon neceſsitie, &amp; to ſuch an vſe as is worthie the holines thereof: and for his part alſo giueth vs an example. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are to conclude, that this is a point of great importance and maruellous profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs to know, that hee which ſhould be the redeemer of the people, ſhould alſo haue the title both of a king &amp; a prieſt. And in deed, if wee ſhould ſeperate the one from the other, the faith that wee haue in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould be verie weake, and ſhould haue no certaine nor firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. For, there are two things requiſite to our ſaluation: the one is, that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs as rightuous, and voweth vs for his children: the other is, that we might be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his hand, and mainteined and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by his inuincible power. If we ſhould take but one of theſe points, wee ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it but by halfes. And marke how: Put the caſe that God were mercifull vnto vs, and would not impute vnto vs our ſinnes, yet if the diuell had power ouer vs, and we left as a praie vnto all the aſſaults wherwith he ſhould aſſaile vs: how could it otherwiſe be, but that we muſt be moſt miſerable caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies. On the other ſide, if God ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13060:22"/>diſplay his power for our defenſe, and yet we not reconciled vnto him, and ſo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and holden to be righteous and iuſt: no doubt of it but that wee muſt needes ſtill come to reckoning. And then woe vnto vs, when as we ſhould be iudged without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. But we know, that all our righteouſnes conſiſteth in this, that God hath mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, and hath buried all our offences. And therefore it behoueth, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould ſhewe himſelfe to bee both a King and a Prieſt, that is to ſaie, that hee ſhould on the one ſide make an attonement betweene God and vs, to the end wee might boldly come when as we were driuen to call vpon him for aide, and aſſure our ſelues that he voweth vs for his children. And all this we haue by the benefite of the death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For, in that hee ſhead his blood, it was to to waſh &amp; cleanſe vs of all our ſpots: hee was made a ſacrifice of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on, ſo that we thereby are diſcharged of an our debts, &amp; the obligation that was againſt our ſaluation, was, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Colloſsians,</hi> broken &amp; cancelled. Thus we ſee what it was that was accompliſhed in the perſon of the ſome of God,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.14.</note> when as he was ſent into the world: that is, that in ſuffering for the remiſsion of our ſins, hee hath made vs righteous. Not that we are in truth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13060:23"/>ſo: for there wanteth a great deale of it: but wee are ſo farre righteous, as that GOD will not iudge vs according to our deſertes: and contrariwiſe, he by his infinite goodneſſe ſupporteth vs, and the obedience which Ieſus Chriſt performed is approoued and allowed vnto vs. As if any man ſhould paie our debts: why then we are diſcharged. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the principall debtter for vs, and therby diſchargeth vs before God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the diuell haue any thing wherwith to accuſe vs, when as we ſhall truſt vnto the ſatisfaction which was paide for vs by the ſonne of God. And therefore it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that he is called a prieſt. Howbeit, we for our parts are rightly to conſider, what fruit and benefite wee are to receiue by this his office of prieſthood. For it is not for him ſelfe alone but for our profite and welfare, that the father by a ſolemne oath beſtowed this eſtate and dignitie vpon him. Now, wee are here to note, that he is called a Prieſt for euer, to the end this honour might be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to him, and tranſported to none other. If this point then had been ſo well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it ought, and as the Apoſtle moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſetteth it downe in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.8.9.10.</note> Hebrewes. The abhomination that hath been brought into the world, and which to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13060:23"/>this day ruleth and reigneth therein, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene: for the Pope maketh his prieſts with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition to appaiſe God. For, theſe are the very words which he vſeth when hee charmeth them, that is to ſay, hee prieſteth them with theſe words of authoritie: <hi>WE GI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E THEE POWER TO OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FER SACRIFICE VNTO GOD, TO APPAISE HIM.</hi> What an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy is this? For this is as much as to make GOD a lyar, and to make voyd the ſolemne oath which hee hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his owne mouth, and which is ſpoken of in the hundreth and tenth Pſalme that wee haue alledged, where God ſaith, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt ſhall bee a Prieſt for euer, euen he alone:</hi> that is, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who hath not his like or match. And yet notwithſtanding, behold how the Popiſh Prieſt bragge that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp Ieſus Chriſt, and that they are Gods Prieſts to make reconciliation for the ſinnes both of the quicke and of the dead. For they are not content to redeem ſuch as by them ſelues out of their clowches, as out of the hands of the eues: but will haue alſo their Prieſting witcherie extend it ſelfe euen to the dead. Wee ſee heere, that there is a conſtraint more then manifeſt, betweene this decree which is pronounced and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13060:24"/>by the holie mouth of GOD, and that which Antichriſt hath falſly deuiſed, and which euen at this day hee ſtill vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and mainteineth. Wee are therefore to note: that Ieſus Chriſt did not offer vp himſelfe onely once for all, to the end to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiſe the wrath of God his father towardes vs, and to paie all our debtes: but that alſo the power of this oblation which hee made ſhould endure for euer, and qee permanent. And therefore we may ſee why the Apoſtle vſeth this ſimilitude,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.29.</note> That the way is as it were a freſhe conſecrated vnto vs by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, that the blood which was once ſhed for our ſaluation, is neuer drawne drie, but daily ouerfloweth our ſoules by the power of his holy ſpirit, which bedeweth vs with the ſame, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his firſt canonicall Epiſtle ſpeaketh. Mark alſo why Ieſus Chriſt in his Supper, ſaith, <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament,</hi> and ſo conſequently ſor euer: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, that wee ſhould not thinke that he had made a reconciliation which ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and as though it had bin but for a day or a yeare only: but that at this day hee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth the place of a prieſt. Becauſe hee is the Mediator vnto God his father, in the power of the death and paſsion which once
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13060:24"/>he ſuffered: and doth make interceſsion for vs, as that we are aſſured that we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, when as we come vnto him in the name of our Aduocat: and are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſetled vppon the oblation which he once made, to the end it might ſerue vs at this day, and vnto the worlds end. I haue alreadie ſaid, that it were not inough that wee were thus ſet at one with God, and our ſinnes forgiuen vs, without we were eftſoons defended and conſerued, vnder his mightie hand and protection. And therefore it was meet that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be a king. For, all the ſaluation that we muſt looke for from the hand of God, muſt come from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. We muſt not flie in the ayre to looke a farre of for that which we want: for he giueth and offreth himſelfe vnto vs. And therefore we muſt in the perſon of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, finde out all fulneſſe of that which is requiſite for our ſaluation. For that cauſe is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt called a king: the vnction which was beſtowed on him apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth vnto his kingdome, to the ende wee might be enriched with all his benefites, and defended againſt all our enemies, &amp; to haue him to be an inuincible fortreſſe for vs. And although we be ſet vpon, yet ſhall wee haue alwaies the victorie. Thus we ſee how the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the kingdom of heauen are beſtowed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13060:25"/>vpon vs. And forſomuch as Ieſus Chriſt was repleniſhed with them, in all perfection and fulnes: wee for our parts are voyd of them, and want them. And thefore we muſt come and begge them of him, that he might deale liberally with vs in helping of vs, which hee doth when as he beſtoweth the graces of his holie ſpirit vpon vs, that we might be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to his image: and the diuell repulſed and put to flight. Now I pray you what ſtrength haue we of our ſelues? For the leaſt temptation in the world will throw vs downe, yea and our very ſhadow will make vs as it were vaniſh away. But it is ſaid, that when Ieſus Chriſt ſhall take vs into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, we ſhall be in ſuch a fortreſſe, as that all the enemies wee haue ſhall neuer be able to haue power ouer vs. Now wee ſee a great deale better, that it is not without cauſe that God vſed a ſolemne oath, when as he made our Lord Ieſus Chriſt a King and Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goeth further and ſtandeth vppon the names, for, <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſignifieth a king of righteouſnes. Hee ſheweth vs then hereby, that the kingdom of the ſonne of God is not common, neither yet to bee eſteemed lyke vnto other kingdomes: But that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie thereof is to make vs righteous. For, earthly Princes may verie well bee called
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13060:25"/>righteous, whilſt they faithfully execute their office, abſtaine from outrages, tiranny &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and render to euery man his due: in this ſort they may be ſaid to be righteous. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, there is another manner of righteouſnes In the ſon of God: and it is it, whereof we are made partakers. A man may be as it were an Angel in all vertues: neuertheles this ſerueth no further then for his owne perſon. He may giue good example vnto others, correct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue done amiſſe, look that men liue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly &amp; according to the law: but to make other righteous, paſſeth all mans power. And therefore the righteouſnes of our Lord Ieſus chriſt is not ſhut vp within himſelf to haue it for himſelf only: but ſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat it vnto vs, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his means we may be made iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god. And how ſhuld that be? we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſhewed, that God reputeth vs for iuſt &amp; innocent, when as it pleaſeth him to bury our ſins &amp; iniquities. And again, accordingly as he hath regenerated vs by the ſpirit of our lord Ieſus chriſt, that is alſo to cloath vs with his righteouſnes. Howbeit, this is but in part, whiles we liue in this vorld, our ſins are fully forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we are not ſo reformed, but that there ſtil remaineth in vs infirmities and ſins. And therfore we muſt imbrace this righteouſnes, that is to ſaie, vnto the remiſsion of our ſins.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13060:26"/>But how euer it is, wee ſee in what ſort our Lord Ieſus Chriſt maketh vs partakers of his righteouſnes. Here we ſee the firſt point that we are to note. The ſecond is, of the place <hi>Salem.</hi> And <hi>Salem,</hi> is as much to ſay as peace: And the Apoſtle ſheweth vs, that ouer and beſides the righteouſnes which wee receiue from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we eftſoones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a peace, which he only openeth, &amp; which by none other meane we can obtaine. And although the wicked, &amp; contemners of God ſtriue to bee at reſt and peace, yet doth the Lord ſo awaken them, with a ſpirit of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as that they are like men halfe dead. For marke how the wicked ſtriue to bee at reſt and peace. That is, they forget God as much as in them lieth, &amp; ſo become very brutiſh. And yet in deſpight of their teeth, God will put them in minde of him, and when hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth vnto them, they tremble as before their Iudge. And beſides, they haue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſand witneſſes: for their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are more then all the actions in the world, yea they cannot but condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And although God ſeemeth to hold his peace, yet cannot the wicked be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that they muſt needes be enforced to feele their curſe.<note place="margin">Eſay 48.22. and 57.21.</note> And therefore as <hi>Eſaie</hi> witneſſeth. <hi>There is no peace for the wicked.</hi> But as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Epheſians, <hi>Chriſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13060:26"/>is our peace,</hi> becauſe hee hath conioyned and vnited vs vnto God his father.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.14.</note> Marke alſo why in the firſt chapter to the Romanes hee ſaith, <hi>That beeing iuſtified by faith, wee are at peace with God.</hi> Hee maketh a difference of the peace of the wicked, that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the peace which they ſeeke after, and cannot finde it, and the peace of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The wicked wil turne their backe vpon God, and flie from him as farre as they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can: but the faithful come before him, and acknowledge him for their father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know that he wil not impute their ſinnes vnto them, forſomuch as Ieſus Chriſt hath forgiuen them, them. And thus haue they peace, and reioyce in the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which hee hath beſtowed vppon them. And therfore it is not without cauſe that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is called the king of peace. And there is more in it then ſo, for the faithfull are not only aſſured for the time preſent, but alſo for the time to come. For they knowe that God hath begun his work in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally that he wil performe it:<note place="margin">Philip. 1.6</note> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their truſt is, that hee will neuer faile them, but that he will more and more guide and gouerne them vntill they come vnto his kingdome. Thus we ſee how we haue peace, and ſhall poſſeſſe it in Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe that without him we cannot be but the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13060:27"/>of God: and as we make warre againſt him through our ſinnes and rebellions, hee cannot chooſe alſo but arme himſelfe againſt vs. Heere is alſo to bee noted, that hee was a Prieſt for euer, when as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was brought in as yeſterday was touched, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, without end, and without any petygree. And it was to this ende that wee might knowe that although our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was in the fulnes of time ſent, yet that he was the ſonne of the eternall God: &amp; that hee was alſo appointed to be the Redeemer before the creation of the world.<note place="margin">Coloſ 1.15 16.17.</note> For, hee is the firſt borne of all creatures, becauſe that in him &amp; by him all things were made, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he according to the wonderfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God, ſhould reſtore all things, forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all things both in heauen &amp; in earth were diſsipated, after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> who ouerthrew all the creatures with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, all things were reſtored by our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: knowing alſo, as the Apoſtle in the laſt Chapter to the Hebrewes ſaith, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt is yeſterday,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.8</note> 
               <hi>and to day, and the ſame for euer:</hi> that his power doth and ſhall ſhew it ſelfe vnto the end of the world. Marke then how wee muſt altogither haue recourſe vnto this power (which the fathers themſelues felt and proued before ſuch time as he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh) nothing doubting, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13060:27"/>although men may be abſent from him, and that there is a great ſpace betweene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth: yet notwithſtanding that we ſhall continually bee quickened by his life, enriched by his benefites, and vpholden and preſerued by his power. For ſeeing the Sunne which is but an inſenſible creature, fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the earth, giueth heate thereunto, and that God by meane thereof, nouriſheth and vpholdeth vs: what ſhall it be in reſpect of Ieſus Chriſt, who is no inſenſible creature, no, no creature at all, but verie God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, yea, our Mediatour, on whome GOD hath beſtowed whatſoeuer is requiſite for our ſaluation. Thus wee ſee in ſumme, what wee haue to learne heereby. Now, where the Papiſts &amp; all ſuch as beare the name of Chriſtians, ought by this place of <hi>Moſes</hi> to bee taught, that Ieſus Chriſt, is an onelie King and Prieſt, that hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vs vnto GOD his Father, and who alſo is the cauſe that the Father holdeth vs vnder his protection, they haue turned it cleane contrarie to that which is here ſet downe.</p>
            <p>And this error was not begunne by the Papiſts, let vs not laie more vpon them then in deede is due vnto them: for they haue blaſphemies inough amongſt them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them ſelues an hundreth tymes.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13060:28"/>But it is great pitie, that the diuel hath ſo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and reigned amongſt them, as that hee hath for theſe fourteene hundreth yeeres ſo blinded thoſe that name themſelues Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as that they are gone ſo farre as to deuiſe a bewitching fantaſie, that Ieſus Chriſt was figured in the perſon of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> &amp; that his bodie is the heauenly brcad, &amp; his blood the wine to nouriſh ſoules, and that he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the one and the other. Now at the firſt ſight, this Allegorie will pleaſe ſuch as haue itching eares: how Ieſus Chriſt calleth his bodie, bread, and his blood, wine. And therefore this ſeemeth verie well to agree, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offered bread and wine, becauſe the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt ought to haue this power in it ſelfe to feed vs, and his blood alſo to quicken our ſoules: howbeit, heere is no ſpeaking of anie oblation made vnto God. But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> king of <hi>Salem,</hi> offered bread and wine, that is to ſaie, that he preſented it vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> It ſhuld here fal out that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> was God, becauſe the oblation was deliuered vp vnto his owne perſon: and yet it was not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, but for his whole company alſo. So here the kingly liberalitie of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> after hee had once friendly receiued him. Now to referre this vnto God, were to peruert the whole ſubſtance of the matter,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13060:28"/>as may be ſeene. And beſides, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, offered his bodie and blood, not that they were before bread &amp; wine: but becauſe they wer offred, they are called bred &amp; wine: that is to ſay, they are of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power &amp; nature of bread &amp; wine vnto vs. For, how is it that our ſoules are ſuſteined by the body &amp; blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; our liues preſerued by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Forſooth it is, becauſe that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was once offered, is the ſumme and perfection of all goodnes. And therefore if Ieſus Chriſt had not been before offred vp, his bodie had not been at this day, meat, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet his blood, drinke. And marke, why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the firſt epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.7.8.</note> 
               <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt our Paſſeouer, was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp for vs:</hi> let vs therefore now eate. And this is the order that we muſt holde: that is, that the oblation be firſt made, that wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, by the power therof might be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and filled with the bodie &amp; blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So that now wee ſee euerie manner of way, that theſe miſerable fantaſticall people who haue corrupted this place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> haue no vnderſtanding of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now the Papiſts (as they haue been poſſeſſed by Sathan, and caſt vp into a reprobate ſenſe, not knowing to iudge betweene white and blacke, and that by the iuſt iudgement of God) haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13060:29"/>ſelues ſo rediculous, as that the verie chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the ſtreets might ſpit in their faces, &amp; yet not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenting themſelues with this erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> haue ſaid, that bread &amp; wine muſt bee daily offred vp: ſith the prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt is anſwerable vnto the prieſthood of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech.</hi> Wheras firſt of all they are conuinced by their owne mouthes of ouer groſſe follye. For they ſay that in their Maſſe, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth neither bread nor wine after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration or rather charming of their Oſte as they call it, but euen God himſelfe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee ſee bread, &amp; the wine that diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, yet they ſay they ar but ſpeeches, that is to ſay, viſible figures, in which is no ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For, they wold make men beleeue that there is neither bread nor wine, and ſo neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue either their ſight, taſt, or yet any of the reſt of all their ſences. And yet in the meane while they make men belieue that it is al no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when as they haue pronounced the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental words, as they terme them. So that if they ſhould offer vp bread &amp; wine, where are they? For they ſay, that there is none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there. And yet for al that, they allege this text, &amp; ſay that there muſt be bread &amp; wine offered vp. We ſee then their beaſtlines to be ſo groſſe, as that very children may laugh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13060:29"/>to ſcorne, and be their iudges. And beſides, if they will haue any correſpondence between <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then muſt the Pſalme which wee haue alledged,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> needes bee true: that is, that there is but one prieſt, who was made by a perticuler oath. And therfore he muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually keep his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: howbeit, they make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues prieſts in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roome of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And thus is their ſimilitude caſt to ground. And therfore we ſhall not need any other replies nor argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute their beaſtlines, but take the text barely as it lieth: &amp; therwithall eftſoons take their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own mouths to cut their owne throtes. But be as be may, we ſee that by this text there is a ſinguler doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine &amp; inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the diuell ſtraineth himſelf to darken, bring in doubt, &amp; falſefie: yea &amp; if it wer poſsible, vtterly to ouerthrow it. And therefore wee for our partes ought ſo much the more awake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our dull ſences, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in our memories that which is here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, &amp; the rather incited therunto by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſolemne oath that God was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pronounce. For, as if we haue alreadie ſaid, it was not without cauſe that he ſoſwore by his name. But it was to the ende, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to confirme our faith, that we ſhould not doubt but that, whatſoeuer is requiſite for our righteouſneſſe, peace, and defenſe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13060:30"/>leadeth vs vnto the kingdome of heauen, through Ieſus Chriſt his onely ſonne. And this is it that wee are heereby to learne. Hee ſaith anon after, <hi>THAT MELCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEDECH BLESSED ABRAM,</hi> becauſe hee was the Prieſt of the high God. This bleſsing importeth a ſuperioritie, as the Apoſtle very well aduertiſeth vs, when as hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.7</note> 
               <hi>That the better bleſſeth the leſſe.</hi> And therefore in the qualitie of a prieſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> muſt needes be inferiour to <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi> And yet it is ſaid, that <hi>Abram</hi> was the father and head of the church: and therfore we muſt needes conclude, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> repreſented a greater perſon then any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man could be. And this was it that made many of the Fathers imagine him to bee an Angell: but thoſe are verie fooliſh &amp; mere toyiſh inuentions. For, when he is called the Prieſt of the liuing God, no doubt of it hee was knowne to be a man in the country, and alſo King of <hi>Salem.</hi> And this is as great a mockery: for put the caſe it had ben an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, yet ſhould he not haue bin greater then <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> in this generall paternitie of the whole church. And therefore we muſt come backe vnto this: which is, that although <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> was a mortall man, yet ſurpaſſed hee in dignitie the Angels of heauen, by reaſon of his prieſthood: not as of himſelfe, but hy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13060:30"/>reaſon of him whoſe figure he beare: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was far greater then all the Angels, when it was ſaid of him, <hi>Thou art my ſonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.7. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>this daie haue I begotten thee.</hi> This was not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith the Apoſtle, of any Angel: and yet was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> a wretched ſinner, the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as well as any of the reſt. And how then is it here, that he is ſo highly exalted, as that the Angels are made inferiors vnto him? It is becauſe that this figure repreſented the maieſtie of the ſonne of God, &amp; not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Dauid</hi> alone. Wee muſt then come to this point, that <hi>Melchiſidech</hi> could not bee aboue <hi>Abram,</hi> but in regarde of the truth which he figured. And therefore wee muſt conclude, that Ieſus Chriſt was euen then declared, to the end that the beliefe of the faithfull might bee altogither grounded on him: becauſe there was none other ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen vnder heauen from the beginning, but the ſame which is at this daie reuealed vnto vs in the Goſpell. Now, it is true that there is a common kinde of bleſsing. For, to <hi>bleſſe,</hi> is oftentimes taken in the holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for to praie: as hereafter wee ſhall ſee, that one common man, bleſſeth another ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God bleſſe thee: as when we ſalute one another, they are bleſſings, this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe of the holie ſcriptures. But there is a ſinguler bleſsing which is reſerued for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13060:31"/>the prieſtes. And therefore marke, why it is ſo often ſaide in the lawe, <hi>The prieſtes which bleſse the people in the name of God,</hi> that is to ſay, which haue that authoritie giuen them thereto. And the ſame forme hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs in the ſixt Chapter of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, where it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Num. 6.23.24.25 26. Luk. 1.24.50.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſhall the prieſtes bleſse my people, The Lord bleſse you and keepe you, the Lorde make his face to ſhine vpon you.</hi> And againe, <hi>The Lord be fauourable vnto you: and grant you his peace.</hi> Thus wee ſee what a form the Lord hath ſet downe in his church. And for this cauſe alſo it is ſaid, when as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt aſcended into heauen, that he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his handes ouer his Apoſtles, as the prieſtes did: to the end to accompliſh the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the lawe, in bleſsing his Diſciples. This then is the bleſsing which is heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.7.</note> And marke why the Apoſtle reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not without cauſe, that it muſt needs be that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in this qualitie was farre more excellent then <hi>Abram,</hi> becauſe hee bleſſed him. And yet is <hi>Abram</hi> the father of the whole Church. We are therfore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath a farre greater maieſtie then any earthly maieſtie hath or can haue, and that in the perſon of the Mediator. Wherefore all power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie muſt bee ſubiect vnto him and regard him, and both great and ſmall muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13060:31"/>and confeſſe that God his father hath giuen vnto him the chiefe aucthoritie euen in this humane nature of his, and euery knee muſt how and kneele vnto him. Thus we ſee how theſe wordes of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Philippians, are to be vnderſtood.<note place="margin">Philip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.9.10.</note> And this is it which we are to remember. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now that wee apply theſe wordes to our own vſe &amp; benefit, that is, we muſt not doubt but that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abram</hi> in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, euen as at this daye our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is the euerlaſting Prieſt, bleſſeth vs in the name of God his Father. For this praier which is here ſet downe is not in vain, but muſt needes bee effectuall: becauſe wee know that it could not bee otherwiſe choſen but that he muſt needs be heard. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that ſo long as wee put our truſt in Ieſus Chriſt, wee haue him for our Aduocate towards God his Father: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are curſed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring a new curſe vpon our heads through our ſins &amp; tranſgreſsions: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame ſhall hereby be blotted out &amp; prepared, in that our lord Ieſus chriſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth in deed &amp; in truth, to take vpon him the office to bleſſe vs. We ſee alſo the praier which he once made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel after S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in this maner. <hi>Holy father I do not onely pray here vnto thee for theſe (to wit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.20 21.</note> 
               <hi>for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apoſtles
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13060:32"/>and Diſciples which he had choſen vnto himſelf) But I pray alſo for all thoſe which ſhall belieue in my name through their preaching, that they may all be one in me, as I am one in thee, and that wee may be all one.</hi> In this ſort did our ſauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt pronounce theſe words out of his owne month: to wit, that he praid not for his Diſciples alone, which were of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but alſo for as many as belieue in him through their preaching. Let vs heere then learne, that when ſoeuer wee ſhall imbrace the doctrine of the Ghoſpell in true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that wee be ſurely perſuaded that the ſonne of God is giuen to vs for our ſouereign and onely good. Thus we ſee how powerfull his praier will alwaies be: for it is needleſſe for him to beginne the ſame at euening, at morne, &amp; euerie day. For it is ſufficient that he hath ſealed it with his blood, and by that onely and euerlaſting ſacrifice which hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp once for all. For, wee are aſſured to haue our praiers heard, when as we pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in the name of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. For, our praiers ſhuld ſtink, yea &amp; infect the aire, if wee conſidered what God is, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward conſidered what wee our ſelues are. Howbeit our praiers are made holy through the prieſtly bleſsing of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, vnto whom we muſt looke that wee might bee partakers of all his benefites.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13060:32"/>Thus we ſee in ſumme, how we are to applie this ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> vnto our benefite, and the building vp of our faith, where it is ſaid, That <hi>Abram</hi> the father of the faithfull was bleſſed. We ſee herein, that <hi>Abram</hi> as of him ſelfe was accurſed, ſith hee was faine to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the prieſtly bleſsing. And <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> alſo right well knew, that there is nothing in vs but miſerie and wretchednes, and that it is God that muſt bleſſe vs, and that we muſt imbrace it with all humilitie, if wee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the benefite that is brought vnto vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and which hee daily offreth vnto vs by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Now hereupon, <hi>Moſes</hi> reciteth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Melchiſedech, BLESSED ART THOV ABRAM,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>OF GOD MOST HIGH, posſeſſer of heauen and earth, And bleſsed bee the moſt high God that hath deliuered thine enemies into thy hand:</hi> hee bleſſed <hi>Abram</hi> in the name of God, as wee haue alreadie alledged out of the law. Wee muſt not heere vnderſtand, that when the prieſtes haue the office to bliſſe, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth as from their owne authoritie, and that God hath reſigned his office ouer vnto them, and his honour and praiſe to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſo much leſſened. For when God worketh by his Miniſters, yet loſeth hee thereby no part of his dignitie, neither is his power ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13060:33"/>by anie whit obſcured, or yet anie thing of that which he giueth taken from him. But it pleaſeth him to vſe theſe means with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that men ſhould alwaies come againe vnto him, &amp; not draw any one drop of good from any other fountain then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſpring head. Here we ſee namely why it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art thou Abram of God moſt high:</hi> as if <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> ſhould haue ſaid: that he is nothing of himſelf, nor can do any thing as of himſelf. But ſeeing that God had called him to ſerue him, that he ſhould alſo call vpon him, &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie likewiſe his name vnto <hi>Abram.</hi> We ſee then, that it is the office of Ieſus Chriſt to bleſſe, that is to ſay, to make vs agreeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to blot out all the iniquitie that is in vs. But this muſt conduct vs to God a great deale hier: that is, vnto the ineſtimable loue of God the Father,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> who ſpared not his onelie ſon, but deliuered him to death for vs. When the principall cauſe of our ſaluation is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs, the ſcripture ſetteth before vs the loue of God:<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>God then ſo loued the world, as that he ſpared not his onely ſonne.</hi> Thus wee ſee how wee are bleſſed by the prieſtly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of this Sonne of GOD. Howbeit, the Father notwithſtanding calleth vs vnto him, that wee might honour him, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo great a benefite that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to beſtow vppon vs, euen through
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13060:33"/>that ſpring-head.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, we ſee here, that all the good which wee are to deſire and hope for, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from God alone, from whome alone we muſt looke to receiue and haue the ſame. Euerie man deſireth to liue eaſily and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and to haue whatſoeuer he thinketh to bee fit for him. And this is a wiſh which is common both with the good and the bad. But fewe there are that ſeeke for their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in God. They deſire all to bee happie and bleſſed: and yet they make no account of him from whome all bleſſednes and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie proceedeth. And this kinde of dealing is like vnto a man which were ſo meruellous thirſtie, and feeble as that he were readie to giue vp the ghoſt withall, and another ſhould come vnto him and ſay, Behold here is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fine ſpring of water, and yet hee would not once vouchſafe to drinke of it: and ſhould haue there alſo water and wine, and yet would not once come neere to taſte of the ſame. Euen ſo fareth it with ſuch as deſire and couet to vnderſtand whatſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into their ſaid braines, and which they alſo knowe to bee meete and requiſite for them, and yet notwithſtandyng doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne GOD, and will in no wiſe come neere him. Let vs then learne, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we deſire to haue either for our ſoules
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13060:34"/>our bodies that which is to be wiſhed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at this end, that God is merciful vnto vs, and doth ſo receiue vs to his mercie, as that wee may approach and haue enterance vnto him, and may be ſo ſatisfied with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites as may bee profitable for our ſaluation. Thus then wee ſee what it is that wee are to obſerue by this ſaying: <hi>That Abram is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, euen of the moſt high God.</hi> After this, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> addeth a bleſsing, in that God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> victory vnto our father <hi>Abram. AND BLESSED</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>BE THE LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VING GOD THAT HATH DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIVERED THINE ENEMIFS INTO THINE HAND.</hi> By this we are admoniſhed, alwaies to ioyne praiſe and thankeſgiuing vnto God, with the petitions and ſupplications which we make vnto him, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo ſheweth vnto vs in his Epiſtle to the Philippians,<note place="margin">Philip. 4.6.</note> when hee ſaith: <hi>Let your deſires and petitions be manifest to God.</hi> That is to ſay, bite not vpon the bit ſaith hee, as the infidels do, when as they ſee this thing were good and fit for mee. They complaine. But wherefore? Their hearts are euen cloſed vp, and neuer come vnto GOD to craue at his hands the things which they want. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith in that place, Poure put your petitions, thoughts, and deſires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: that is to ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you know your
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13060:34"/>ſelues to want this thing and that: ſeeke for the benefite where it is, and there you may finde it, to wit, in God: Let your praiers, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and thankeſgiuings, ſhewe that you are before God: &amp; when you haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as I haue before ſaid: Let your thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing bee conioyned with your petitions. For, if we pray murmuringly, &amp; with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and diſcontented minde, that is to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his holie name. And therefore our praiers muſt be a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſauour. For we do him great wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie when as we will make him to ſubmit him ſelfe and be ſubiect to our appetites, and not be contented with his fauour and grace. We ſee then why we ought to be roundly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as often as we pray vnto God, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto him alſo praiſe and thanks, &amp; yeeld our ſelues wholly to his will, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe, all the benefits which we haue receiued at his hands: as in the Pſalme it is ſaid: <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>and I will heare thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and thou ſhalt praiſe and glorifie me.</hi> And after this ſort, wee ſee howe <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> doth here the like as touching <hi>Abram.</hi> Now, that we may the more family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly comprehend this matter, we are to note, that our praiers are to haue regard as wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time paſt, as vnto the time to come, &amp; for the time paſt, to confeſſe vnto God the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13060:35"/>benefits which we haue alreadie receiued of him: and for the time to come, to craue of his maieſtie, that it would pleaſe him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and perſeuere the ſame his mercie vnto vs as he hath begun, euen vnto the end. Now we are here eſpecially to note this one thing: that althogh <hi>Abram</hi> was ſo mightily aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as to be made the father of the faithfull, to be bleſſed of God with all vertues, and to haue a moſt excellent ſpirit of faith: yet <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> neuertheles told him that hee was continually to go forward and increaſe from grace to grace vnto the ende, and daily haue recourſe vnto God to call vppon him. For, when he bleſſed him, he read him eftſoones a leſſon, which hee was well to looke vnto, and to practiſe the ſame alſo all the daies of his life. If it behoued then <hi>Abram,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to call vpon God, what graces ſoeuer he had receiued, and how honourable ſoeuer he was, and yet notwithſtanding muſt alwaies bee exerciſed in praiers and ſupplications: what then ſhall become of vs that are ſo far inferiour vnto him in all theſe things? Thus then wee ſee, why I haue ſaid that our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould haue reſpect vnto the time to come, ſeeing wee haue alwaies need of God his helpe, to haue mercie vpon vs, and heale vs, and more and more to encreaſe his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in vs. And beſides, theſe praiers of ours
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13060:35"/>muſt haue regard vnto the times paſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our giuing; of thanks and praiſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for the ſame: that is, we muſt proteſt that whatſoeuer good wee haue commeth from him: and bee ſo contented as that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee ſhould be neuer ſo much vexed and grieued: yet muſt we ſtill reioyce, forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we haue knowne and proued him to bee a father vnto vs, and hath alſo ſhewed himſelfe to bee ſuch a one in deed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the benefites which hee hath heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore beſtowed vppon vs. And this is it which wee are heere to obſerue. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the words of <hi>Melchiſedech, BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED BE GOD WHICH HATH DELIVERED THINE ENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIES INTO THINE HAND.</hi> The ſame telleth vs that all victorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from GOD. And alſo that <hi>Abram</hi> through his owne induſtrie, prowes, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, diſcomfite not the Kings of whome mention is made: but GOD whiche conducted him. True it is, that <hi>Abram</hi> ſurpriſed his enemies in the night, as wee haue heard, and hee did it becauſe hee was no expert man of warre: now to what ende ſerueth all this, ſaue onely to ſhewe that it was GOD whiche gaue him that proſperous ſucceſſe? Wee ſee alſo, that although <hi>DA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ID</hi> had a ſtrong
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13060:36"/>and mightie araie, and had valiant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed ſouldiers, and himſelfe likewiſe an expert man of warre, beſides, that God had made him a king,<note place="margin">Pſal 18.32.33.</note> yet hee ſaith: <hi>That it was God that had giuen him the feet of an Hart, that it was he that had aduanced him, and ſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened him, as that he brake in ſunder the barres of braſſe, &amp; that it was he that had ouerthrowne his enemie. Dauid</hi> then proteſteth that there was nothing in him as of himſelfe that got him all his victories. Seeing then that <hi>Dauid</hi> who in the iudgement of men had the means to diſcomfit his enemies, and yet confeſſeth without hipocriſie, that all was to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, and vnto himſelfe, to the end, that his name might thereby bee glorified: what ſhall we then ſay <hi>Abram,</hi> who neuer in all his life followed the warres, neither yet euer knew, as a man would ſay, how to draw a ſword? And yet notwithſtanding, that hee ſhould vanquiſh ſuch a multitude of people, who were alreadie puffed vp with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon they had diſcomfited their enemies, and pilled and ſacked fiue Cities: and therefore we muſt needs conclude, that it was the Lord which did it. Now therefore how euer it is, wee are to gather from this place, that if wee lift vp but one of our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we muſt confeſſe it to be God that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteth vs thereunto, to the end wee might
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13060:36"/>not take vpon vs any thing with a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous arrogancy, as if we could do any thing of our ſelues, and were men of abilitie and great power. Let thoſe then which are to take in hand warres, or gouernments of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, or any other matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, put themſelues into rhe hands of God, knowing that it is not without cauſe that hee is called the God of Hoſtes. And thus much for this point. Moreouer, wee are to apply this vnto a ſecond vſe: which is concerning the ſpirituall power that is giuen vnto vs to ſurmount &amp; ouercome Sathan, with all, and whatſoeuer is againſt our ſaluation: <hi>We fight not</hi> (faith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>againſt fleſh &amp; blood, but againſt principalities &amp; powers in high places, &amp; againſt the diuels which haue fiery dartes flying.</hi> Thus wee ſee how wee muſt bee exerciſed. Seeing then that the diuell is our principall enemie, and that the darts, ſwords, and all the meanes which he hath to hurt vs, are ſpirituall, let vs learne to call vpon our God. For, what power haue we? Or what agilitie? And therefore it is God that muſt fight for vs, and let vs bee quiet &amp; ſtil, and ſtand as if we had our hands bound behind vs: and yet not ſo neither, but that we muſt do our endeuours: becauſe all the faithfull muſt valiantly fight againſt the luſtes of their fleſh: and yet muſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer come from aboue, and they aduichilate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13060:37"/>all opinion of their free-will and ſtrength, which is the drunkennes of Popery, when as they proudly lift themſelues vp againſt GOD.

               <hi>ſhould not be onely a king, but alſo a priest after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> We haue alſo ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed why all this was ſpoken, to what purpoſe it ſerueth vs, and what benefite wee receiue thereby. Laſtly, the bleſſing likewiſe was ſet foorth, that is, that through the power of the office and order which was in <hi>Melchiſedech, Abram</hi> was bleſſed, thereby to ſhew that all our praiers ſhould bee abhominable before the maieſtie of God, and be able to obtaine nothing at his handes, without Ieſus Chriſt made interceſsion for vs, which office is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto him in the holie ſcripture. Now it is here ſaid, <hi>That Abram gaue tithe of all vnto Melchiſedech.</hi> This therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth a prieſtly dignitie that was in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> as is well remembred by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. We muſt not hereupon, certainly collect,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.4</note> whether theſe wordes haue relation to the ſpoile, or to <hi>Abram</hi> his owne goods. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee receiued no part of the ſpoile to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite himſelfe, it is not likely that he meant to giue vnto <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> that thing which lee tooke not to be his owne. But hee had another maner of reaſon &amp; diuerſitie of his acknowledgement vnto God, and to apply the benefite vnto his owne vſe, for the enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of himſelfe. Neuertheles how euer it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13060:39"/>is, it is ſufficient that wee hold that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> certain, that is to ſay, that <hi>Abram</hi> proteſteth that hee acknowledged <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> to be Gods prieſt. For if he had ſerued Idols, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped any dignitie which belonged not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Abram</hi> had done very ill in giuing him tithe: becauſe wee know, that to offer ſacrifice vnto Idols is to honour them, and to forſake God. This oblation then of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> muſt needes teſtifie and approoue the prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> And therefore we ſee why the Apoſtle comparing the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prieſthood of the law, with the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.9.10.</note> that <hi>Leuy</hi> which was yet in <hi>Abrams</hi> loynes, paide tithes: that is to ſay, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to that law. Wee might alſo alledge the like of <hi>Iudah,</hi> of whome our Sauiour Chriſt came. Howbeit that is eaſily anſwered, to wit, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> cannot be ſeperated from our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee repreſenteth him, and that all the excellency which in him dependeth hereon, in that hee is the figure of Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore the Apoſtle by great reaſon ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that hee to whome the right of tithes by the law apperteined, was yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnder <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> We muſt therfore from hence conclude, that our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt is farre more excellent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13060:39"/>then euer was <hi>Aaron,</hi> or yet all his ſucceſſors, albeit they were in that reſpect ſeperated as it were from the companie of men. And when the prieſt had all his prieſtly garments vpon him, it was but to ſhew that hee was as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And notwithſtanding that all this was ſo, yet neuertheles, the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt farre excelled him in honour, and muſt bee exalted aboue all the figures of the law, that men thereby might ſee him to bee the very truth and ſubſtance of them all. And that although men did take all the ſhadowes that euer were for a time, yet ſhould they profite nothing, and ſhould be all of none effect, except they came to the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne. Let vs therefore well conſider, that when <hi>Abram</hi> offered all the tithes to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> that it was to ſhew, that although God ſhould eſtabliſh ſoone after an order of prieſthood in his people, yet that it did no whit derogate from the prieſthood of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie figured in the perſon of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as it was at that time alreadie eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreouer, as concerning the giuing of tithes vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts, we ſee that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> did it before
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13060:40"/>there was any law written: and therefore it is without all doubt, that it was the ſpirit of God which induced him and pricked him foreward thereunto. For, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite here, this to bee a thing done at rando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> &amp; without reaſon: but rather declareth that God ratified the office of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as hee meant to make him his prieſt, and that <hi>Abram</hi> acknowledged him to be ſo. Howbeit, wee muſt not from hence gather that there was any general law for the ſame, ne yet that the faithfull were bound to paie tithes, except that God alſo had inſtituted it in his law: which was done not only becauſe they ſhould honour him with the fruites of the earth, with proteſtation that they came all of his meere bounteous liberalitie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it ſimply for the maintenance of the Miniſters of the Aultar, that is to ſay, for the maintenance of thoſe that ſerued in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but becauſe they came of the ſeede of <hi>Abram.</hi> So that one part of the land belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto them, who were to take poſſeſsion therof,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7</note> as it was ſaid to <hi>Abram: Thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſse the land.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t was before aſsigned vnto him by God him ſelfe. And that is the reaſon why his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are recompenſed with tithes. Now God did this for two reaſons: the firſt is, becauſe they ſhould not bee diſtracted neither from the ſeruice which was committed to their charge, ne yet from doctrine. For God choſe not the prieſts vnder the law, for performing of the ceremonies only: but for another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Mala. 2.7</note> that is, he ordeined them to be his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, to the ende wee ſhould demand from their lippes the true knowledge &amp; pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the law. Wherefore becauſe the prieſtes might haue leiſure inough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the ſeruice of the Temple, and to teach the people: the tithes were appointed for them. And for that cauſe alſo, were they diſperſed all the country ouer. They had no ſeueral and proper pertition, to ſay that they might dwell in any one certaine country as the reſt did: but were ſowen here and there: to the end there ſhould be no corner in the world where God not would haue his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers &amp; lawiers to keep his people in awe. Here (I ſaie) we ſee the reaſon why GOD would haue them to haue the tithes, and not buſie themſelues about tilling and ſowing of the earth. The ſecond reaſon is this, that if they had poſſeſſed the earth, God had not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13060:41"/>been knowne to be Lord and maiſter as hee was, when as Leuiticall prieſts were become as it were his Receiuers, and had ſent them in his name to take vpon them the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; to demand the homage which was due vnto him vpon the earth. And beſides, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> receiued that which was due vnto them by ſucceſsion and inheritance of their father <hi>Abram,</hi> yet for all that God as it were wold ſeem to ſhew vnto them that the earth was his, &amp; kept the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie therof vnto himſelf, &amp; that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the ſame with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that what ſoeuer they had, they muſt hold as of him, &amp; ſhew the ſame alſo in deed &amp; in effect to be ſo. And therwithal alſo, that there ſhould be oblations beſtowed vpon the poore, of thoſe tithes: for it is not ſaid that the prieſts ſhuld eat and drinke vp all, but keepe themſelues within compaſſe, thereby to ſhew that they were not exempt from the generall law, but were beholden to God for the food which they did eat, and that all came from his pure &amp; meere goodnes. We ſee then how that the tithes which were conteined in the law were eſpecially for the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding the tithes were verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt the Heathen, euen for kings, princes, and noble men.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13060:41"/>and that in ſome countries they exacted more then in other ſome, according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe that had but leane and barren ground, to paie the tenth part. But bee as bee may, this worde Tythe or Tenth, hath beene a common and ordinary amongſt all nations. And all Princes and great men as I haue alreadie ſaide, ſithens the Ghoſpell was receiued, haue beſtowed part of the tithes towardes the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the worde, as is verie great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul, That they which miniſtred at the Aulter in the olde Teſtament were mainteined, that they which at this daie ſacrifice vnto God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more excellent manner,</hi> that is, which winne ſoules vnto him, to make of them ſacrifices vnto his maieſtie, that they ſhould alſo bee as well prouided for and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined: and although GOD hath not quallified how nor by what manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue they ſhould bee mainteined, yet is there a lawe for it. Now then, ſith God hath been knowne through the preaching of the Ghoſpell, a Chriſtian order and lawe hath been made, for the giuing and beſtowing of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13060:42"/>one part of tithes. And herein wee may ſee the deceit of the Pope and of his ſhauelings: for, when they handle the lawe of tithes in their Canons, they take it as if it were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to them after that Ieſus Chriſt had put an end vnto the prieſthood of <hi>Leuy.</hi> All theſe are very leaſings, falſefying the holie ſcripture, &amp; wickedly corrupting the ſame. For we ſee to the contrary, as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed, that it is long ago ſithence, that it was not knowne what the paying of tithes was by vertue of the lawe of <hi>Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and they were always paide either to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or to ſome other perticuler great men. But now ſith the thing hath bin ſo ordeined (ſo therin be no abuſe, and to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue contrary to all truth, that it came from the holy ſcripture: but to be taken for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike law.) Let vs hold that rule which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.9.10.11.12.13.</note> to wit, <hi>That wee muſle not the mouth of the Oxe when hee trauelleth to feede vs:</hi> and therefore it ſtandeth with a far greater reaſon, that they which preach the doctrine of the Ghoſpell, ordeined in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an eſtate, ſhuld not be abridged and depriued of their maintenance, but be verie well waged. Now as I haue alreadie ſaide, when tithes and ſuch like are beſtowed vnto a good vſe: we muſt not ſo ſtraightly looke into the matter, as to aske the cauſe why it is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13060:42"/>ſo, as many fantaſticall fellowes will, who at this day could bee contented to turne the whole world vpſide downe ſaying, O, it is no time now to paie tithes, for ſeeing the thing hath been ſo long abuſed, it is no reaſon it ſhould any longer continue. Then muſt wee by their ſaying ſcrape out all: for they think that Chriſtianitie conſiſteth in changing the colour of the Sunne and the Moone. But if there be any thing that is to be amended, as I haue ſaid, as if the Papiſts haue brought in any falſe opinion, let that be vtterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But in the meane while, let vs hold vs vnto al good ordenance: to wit, let the tithes and all ſuch things that are for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the poore, and the Miniſters: let theſe thinges bee reduced vnto their lawfull vſe, and let not vnſaciable wide gullets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour all. Let them not conſume them vpon their ſuperfluities, in pompes, drunkennes, and other diſſolutenes: but let them know, that theſe are holy goods, which ought to be reſerued for the vſe of the Church, as well for the maintenance of the poore as I haue alreadie ſaid, as alſo for the feeding of thoſe which ſerue God and his people. Thus wee ſee, that it was fit wee ſhould touch by the way, the lawe concerning tithes: and let vs now go on with that which followeth. <hi>Moſes</hi> now returneth to the king of <hi>Sodome,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:13060:43"/>he had before ſpoken: and ceaſeth to ſpeake of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Hee ſaith, that the king of <hi>Sodome</hi> would haue nothing els but the perſonnes, and leaue all the ſpoyle to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram:</hi> As if hee would haue ſaide, that hee demaunded no whit of that which was taken from him by his enemies, for hee knew verie well that <hi>Abram</hi> had wonne it by conqueſt: he onely required but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and his dwelling place. Wee know not whether he did this hipocritically yea or no, conſidering that all was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> his hands, or whether hee thought in truth that hee was worthie of all, and that it was inough that hee and his people were reſcued from the handes of his enemies. But how euer it was, it is ſaide that <hi>Abram</hi> refuſed that offer, that hee would take nothing that was his, no not ſo much as a thread or a ſhoolatchet. That is to ſaie, not the worth of a pinne as wee commonly ſay: ſaue that, ſaith hee, which the yoong men haue eaten: for they came not thither to paie any recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and beſides, they could haue no leſſe reward for ventring their liues to deliuer the Sodomites. Well ſir, as for that which they haue eaten, let that, I ſay, alone: but as for thoſe that came with mee <hi>Aner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> they muſt needes haue their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpoyle: for I will abridge them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13060:43"/>of no whit of their benefite, neither is it for mee to impoſe a law or matter of neceſsitie vppon them: I am liberall, and therefore I can in no wiſe ſtraighten nor meaſure them. Let them then take their ſhares, as for mee, I will haue nothing. And for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of his ſpeech, hee ſaith, <hi>I haue lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp my hand vnto the Lord the most high GOD, poſseſsor of heauen and earth,</hi> as if hee would haue ſaid, that hee had ſworne and would performe it, becauſe it was not lawfull for him to call backe his word, and ſo thereby ſtoppe his mouth about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wee ſee heere, that <hi>Abram</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to eſchue all offences, when as hee refuſed to reape anie benefite of anie thing that was his. For if the warre which hee had taken in hand was lawfull, that then hee might iuſtly reſerue to himſelfe, in the iudgement of men, whatſoeuer he had taken: but beauſe he would ſhew that hee was not carried away with a couetous deſire, and that hee tooke not armes vpon him for gaine, hee ſaid, <hi>That he would not haue no not ſo much as one thread of his:</hi> and that in ſaying thus, (<hi>To the end thou ſhouldeſt not ſay, that thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched Abram</hi> it is certaine that hee was not ambitious. As oftentimes, we ſhall ſee men of great minde that do willingly deſire to enrich themſelues with other mens goods:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13060:44"/>but becauſe they feare the ſhame &amp; reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world, they will yet for faſhions ſake, ſhew therein a kind of conſtancy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, <hi>Abram</hi> did not ſo: but as I haue ſaid, hee did it becauſe hee would not haue the name of God through his occaſion bee euill ſpoken of. For it might bee ſaid, what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you? This man, for any thing that wee can yet ſee, hath hitherto ſhewed himſelfe to be very ſimple, and that he worſhipped God by himſelfe, and is wonderfull deuout: hee ſaith that hee forſooke his country at the commandement of God, and yet hee maketh warre, robbeth and ſpoileth, and therefore any man may ſee that hee is no better then a theefe. Here wee ſee that vnder the name of <hi>Abram,</hi> the name of God had been hazarded vnto many ſlaunders. And this is the cauſe alſo why hee kept himſelfe within compaſſe. Now this is written for our learning. For, in the firſt place we are to obſerue this rule, that it is not mough that our conſciences be pure before God, but we muſt alſo procure (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> thereof ſheweth vs an example) <hi>To bee reputed and well thought of amongſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi> And why? becauſe they might not condemne vs, by reaſon they ſhuld haue this opinion of vs that we would do no euil thing, but rather ſtir them vp to well doing. True it is, that we ſhall neuer be able to eſcape the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13060:44"/>bitings and barkings of many dogs: yea and although wee were without all blot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, yet will they neuer leaue ſlaundering and euil ſpeaking of vs: for the ſonne of Gnd had his part that way, and all the Prophets and Apoſtles were alſo charged with falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. And therefore (as S <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) wee muſt be alwaies readie to do good, &amp; yet to be euill ſpoken of, to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſcoffed at, reproched and iniuried, for that muſt be our reward: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we muſt as much as in vs lieth, not giue any occaſion to ſuch as hunt after it, but ſtoppe their mouthes to the end the name of God, as I haue alreadie ſaid, be not euil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of through our default. Here we ſee then wherein we are to follow <hi>Abram,</hi> that is, wee muſt vnderſtand that we are looked vnto on euery ſide: yea and although wee were not, yet we owe this duetie vnto our neighbours, not to giue any offence vnto thoſe that are weake: who by vs might take any euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For let vs bee aſſured that there will be alwaies wicked men to ſeeke to accuſe vs, to picke quarrels againſt vs and defame vs: but yet for all this, (as I haue alreadie ſayd,) let vs be cleare aboard and guiltles. For it is the will of God that we ſhould be, as it were, ſet vppon a ſcaffold, to carry his name and badge, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Philippians, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13060:45"/>on the other ſide, ſhine before the wicked: and although they bee froward and peruerſe people, yet let vs walke before them holily and godly: that thereby they may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not being able to finde any thing in vs wherby we may be euill ſpoken of: and that they may by that means be made more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, when as they ſhall ſee vs ſerue God in integritie of life, and themſelues addicted to all fraud, villanies, and ſuch like. Thus we ſee how wee are to put in practiſe this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Now, as concerning <hi>Abram</hi> his act, wee ſee here what a good conſcience he had. For if wane be once taken in hand, we think then that it is lawfull for vs to do what we luſt, as it is ſaid in an auncient prouerbe, That when warres are on foote, then lawes ceaſe: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in deed there is pollicie and lawe, becauſe it is then more requiſite then in the time of peace: and there muſt bee alſo a kinde of ſuperioritie, to the end euery Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine might be obeyed, that all ſouldiers might attend vppon their Enſigne or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that men might not hazard themſelues at all aduentures, and alſo be verie vigilant to beware of the enemy. And therefore theſe things which concerne the factes of Armes, ought to haue rules, lawes, and ſtatutes: and yet notwithſtandyng it is impoſsible to haue anie warres without the committing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13060:45"/>outrages, And this is it alſo, why all ſuch as thinke to drawe their ſwordes, ought to feare and tremble as often as they thinke of the taile and ſequele that it draweth after it. For it is impoſsible but that in ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there muſt bee a great number of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes ſlaine, many houſes, fatherles chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and widowes ſacked and ſpoyled: and that the goods of ſuch as are moſt impotent, ſhall be taken from them, according as the ſouldiour ſhall finde himſelfe to want: and ouer &amp; beſides all this, if they ſhall want mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, &amp; that the belly thinketh it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer famine, they will ſpare nothing. Thus we ſee how warre it ſelfe bringeth alwaies with it confuſion. Moreouer, they that goe a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, although they haue neuer ſo lawfull ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and can ſhew great reaſon and cauſe, to induce them thereunto, yea and be enforced as it were of neceſsitie to follow it: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they will not ſticke to take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie inough and diſpenſe with themſelues in whatſoeuer they do: for thus they wil ſay, If mine enemy had vanquiſhed mee, what would hee haue done? Doo you thinke that hee would haue ſpared either me or mine? Out of doubt if he had conquered mee, hee woulde haue put to ſacke all that I had had, all had gone to hauocke: and ſith it is ſo, why ſhould not I doo the lyke?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13060:46"/>Thus wee ſee how they which make warre diſpenſe with themſelues &amp; take ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as that they thinke they do no hurt when as they ſpoile and ſcrape togither whatſoeuer commeth next to hand: and yet we ſee that <hi>Abram</hi> dealt not ſo. True it is, that when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> entred the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> they ſacked the whole country before them. But why? becauſe the Lord had ſo commanded them, and therefore they could none otherwiſe do: yea they were alſo moſt rigoriouſly plagued, becauſe they ſpared the inhabitants of the land. And beſides, God threatened them, that if they left any one of them aliue, that they ſhould be as goades in their ſides, and as thornes or prickes in their eies. But in this caſe there is a perticuler rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for <hi>Abram</hi> was not appointed by God to put on Armes to purge the Citie of <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; the neighbour Cities, of their inhabitants, nor yet to haue rule ouer them. For he went not onely to recouer his Nephew <hi>Lot:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by that meanes God had alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of the Sodomites &amp; their neighbors, becauſe he would for a little while defer the vengeance which he had prepared for them: <hi>Abram</hi> therfore knowing the reaſon why he had taken Armes vppon him, tooke not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, nor yet ſought cunningly to excuſe himſelfe, as ſuch as hunt after gaine do: but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13060:46"/>ſaid that hee would take nothing. And yet for all that he could not abridge <hi>Aner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> of any portion that was due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, becauſe they were men ouer whom he had no gouernment. For they came thither with him of good wil: and beeing his friends and allies ayded him, to the ende to bring backe his Nephew <hi>Lot:</hi> and therfore would in no wiſe take any of their right from them. Here on the one ſide wee ſee what a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man <hi>Abram</hi> was, and on the other ſide we ſee, although he tooke not the worth of a pinne, yet could it not ſo fare with him, but that he receiued thereby Ioſſe and domage, and that ſuch as were in his company could not chuſe but be ſpoyled: which thing more manifeſtly ſheweth, that whoſoeuer hee is that ſhall begin to make warre, yea although hee might be as it were as an Angell of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that cared not either for gold or ſiluer, and had rather die then vouchſafe once to gaine the worth of an halfepenny, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that hee had aduentured his life: yet notwithſtanding, that warre of it ſelfe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alwaies with it many ſinnes and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or els wonderfull exceſſe: and although it might iuſtly be ſaid to be lawfull, yet can it not be choſen but that great outrage will be committed, and many men come home by weeping croſſe as wee ſay: for, one man
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13060:47"/>ſhall haue his houſe ſet on fire, another ſhall be robbed, another rifled euen to his verie bedſtraw, and another ſhall be ſo ſpoyled of all his wares, as that hee ſhall bee left ſtarke bare. And therfore whenſoeuer there is open warres, there muſt needs be weeping &amp; wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and wringing of hands: wherefore, wee ought continually to be admoniſhed to bee as it were cloſe fiſted: and take heede how they enter into ſuch confuſions, as that there can be found no remedy againſt them, albeit they carried ſuch a mind with them in their gouernment, as the very Angels do, as I haue alreadie ſaid. To bee ſhort, they that iuſtly defend themſelues, and are enforced ſo to do, ought yet ſo wiſely and warily to behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as that they folow at leaſt the ſteps of our father <hi>Abram.</hi> And if it cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be auoided, but that there muſt be great exceſſe, great loſſe &amp; ſpoile committed, yet let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt reſolue thus with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, not to take war in hand raſhly, of ſelf wil, and for ſpoile: but that it bee done for the iuſt defence of a country, when as it ſhalbe inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome wicked &amp; miſchieuous viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For, men may defend themſelues againſt any king or prince, if ſo be they wil ſet vpon ſuch as are deſirous to liue peaceably, and craue their friendſhip. Let men then haue alwaies this regard not to be ambitious &amp; high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13060:47"/>ne yet deſire another mans wealth: or els if any man wil take armes vpon him, let him looke wel to that which is here ſpoken of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and conforme himſelfe after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the holie Ghoſt meant not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him only becauſe he was not couetous, &amp; cared not for gold nor ſiluer: but hath ſet him before vs as a glaſſe, to the end to learne vs what rule to follow to do the like. For, we may finde out fond excuſes inough to couer our careles ſpoiling &amp; robbing: but that wil not ſerue our turnes without we conforme vs vnto the example of our father <hi>Abram.</hi> And this is it that we are to learn from this place. Howbeit, <hi>Abram</hi> contented not himſelf ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and plainly to ſay thus vnto the king of <hi>Sodom:</hi> but he alſo ſweare withal, &amp; ſaid that he had bound himſelf by an oath, to the end to ſtop all mouthes, and cut of all exceptions that the king might not go farther &amp; ſay, wel it were better for thee to take the ſpoile: no ſaith <hi>Abram,</hi> I wil ſtand to that I haue ſayd. And beſides, <hi>I haue lifted vp my hand vnto the Lord the moſt high God.</hi> Now this manner of ſpeech, <hi>of lifting vp the hand,</hi> is becauſe that men which are blockiſh and earthlie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be put in minde when they ſweare, by ſome ſigne &amp; token, that it is as it were to cal God to witnes as iudge. In very deed the word of it ſelf importeth as much, when as we wil ſay
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13060:48"/>I proteſt before God, or as God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or God plague me els. Now, when we vſe this manner of ſpeech, our haires of our heads ſhould ſtand vpright if we lye, or vſe any kinde of deceit, for God will not forſake himſelfe to agree vnto our leaſings, for if he ſhould, hee muſt needes aduihilate his owne maieſtie. For, he is as verily true, as his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is vnchangeable. The words then are ſufficient inough of themſelues: howbeit we are ſo blockiſh and dull, as that we had great need to haue ſome helpes to put vs in mind, and therewithall to make vs tremble before his maieſtie when we ſweare, &amp; therfore we ſee why in all ages men were wont to lift vp their handes, and that by God his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. And men lifted vp their handes in a ſolemne oath, euen as wee doo when wee pray. For, when we lift vp our hands, it is as much as if we beſought God to come downe from heauen to helpe vs: not that he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his place, but that he ſo ſpreadeth forth his power as that wee may feele him to bee preſent in graunting our petitions. Thus we ſee how by ceremonie and our outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, we ſhew that our praiers conioyne vs vnto God, and that by them wee enter hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen through faith, and that God for his part, deſcendeth vnto vs, to ſhew himſelfe to bee at hand. Euen ſo alſo it is ſaide of an oath,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13060:48"/>when as we lift vp our handes, that is, as if we ſhould ſay: I call God to witneſſe, and that I am here before him when as I ſpeake: that if I deale deceitfully, it is as much as if I ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and violated his maieſtie. Now wee ſee the meaning of theſe words. And let vs here note, that the oath of the faithfull, ought to be rightly weighed, two or three times: for they that vſe it, in taking the name of God alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery light occaſion of ſpeech, ſhew themſelues to be contemners thereof. For, if we reuerenced the name of God as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, without doubt wee would not ſo vainly toſſe it vp and downe, as men vſe to toſſe Tennis balles: for when we heare othes toſſed vp and downe in many mens mouths, by that we may perceiue them to be wicked, godles, and profane men, and ſuch as in deed know not God at all. Now, they will not in any wiſe confeſſe that they know not God: for, when a man ſhall heare them both in market place and ſtreet ſweare continually: and thereupon reproue them, this by and by is their anſwere: O good ſir, I promiſe you for mine owne part, I feare God: ſurely ſir, it ſeemeth you do ſo with lye and all. For out of al doubt, if we do fear him in deed, it wold be ſeene by our ſober and wiſe taking of his name in our mouthes, &amp; not by prophaning of the ſame. And in verie deed, when as wee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13060:49"/>ſhall throughly conſider what is the cauſe of an oath, aſſuredly wee ſhall continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke God againſt vs, if we abuſe and corrupt the ſame. For, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mortall men ſweare by one greater then themſelues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.16.13.</note> 
               <hi>and God ſweareth by himſelfe, becauſe there is none grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelf.</hi> And therfore in all othes the name of God muſt be put in. It is very true, that when a man ſhal ſay, <hi>By God,</hi> it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid word by word, that God plagueth and executeth vengeance: men will not ſo ſay, but it is inogh that his name is there put in as iudge. After what ſort then ſo euer wee ſpeake, God is not to be ſo fiſted withal: and beſides, we ſhall gaine nothing at his hands to vſe any ſophiſtication with him, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the ſhame will ſtill light vpon our own heads. Moreouer, if any man at any time would rightly deliuer an oath, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that God ſhal there be named and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to witneſſe. Now, he cannot be a witneſſe without alſo he be a iudge. And beſides, there is now &amp; then curſing and banning, that is to ſay, a man wil beſeech God to plague him as he deſerueth, when ſoeuer he abuſeth his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, we ſee alſo why it is ſo often ſayd in the holy ſcripture, God do thus and thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that is to ſay, God plague mee both in bodie and ſoule. In other places this is not expreſſed, but there is onely an <hi>if,</hi> and is an
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13060:49"/>interrupted kinde of ſpeech as in this place, <hi>I haue lifted vp my handes vnto the Lorde most high God, if ſo be I take any thing thereof.</hi> Now what is the meaning of this? We muſt thus vnderſtand it, Let GOD bee iudge, and plague mee if I lye, and ſpeake not the truth. This broken and interrupted kinde of ſpeech, ſheweth that when wee ſhould ſweare, wee muſt bee helde backe as it were with a byt: to the ende wee do not lightly and vnaduiſedly prouoke the wrath of God. For, out of all doubt, they which ſweare often and at randon, are euerie time forſworne, becauſe they are things that goe hand in hand togither: ſo that when ſoeuer we heare any man ſweare at the Table or in the ſtreetes, a man may boldly ſay vnto him, My friend, you do not onely abuſe the name of God, but are alſo forſworne when as the name of god is thus profaned in your mouth: we are therfore to keep vs within the bounds of ſobrietie, when as we muſt needs take the name of God ſo in our mouthes. But here by the way may riſe a queſtion: whether it was lawfull for <hi>Abram</hi> to ſweare for ſo ſmall a matter: for it is ſayd, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of thy Lorde thy God in vaine.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not <hi>Abram</hi> haue been conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue ſayd plainly, no: I will not haue one iote of anie thing: but whatſoeuer hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13060:50"/>been taken from thee. I will deliuer it thee againe with mine owne hand: for, I will not be the richer by one farthing of that is thine. A man would thinke that if he had ſaid thus it had bin inough: howbeit we ſee what the hipocriſie of men is: for, for honeſties ſake, men will offer wonderful much, and yet they which will thus ſpeake, haue a clean contrary meaning in their harts. Thus we ſee, that they think that a man is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he maketh any ſuch offer in words: for they ſay, that it is but a ſuperfluous kinde of ſpeech, becauſe they thinke not that men which haue ſuch a ciuil courage with them, haue either faith or honeſtie in them, forſomuch as moſt men are ſubiect thereunto: and therefore it ſtood <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> vpon, to ſweare. And beſides, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him alſo to free himſelfe from all kinde of temptation, and ſo hold himſelfe within the compaſſe of his duetie, as that although he might lawfully enrich himſelfe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man his goods, yet that hee ſhould then abſtain from giuing himſelfe any ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and withdraw himſelfe from doing any ſuch thing, by vertue of the oath which hee had ſworne. Wee ſee now hereby, that it was not without cauſe that <hi>Abram</hi> ſaid that hee had ſworne, to the end the king of <hi>Sodome</hi> ſhould by no means haue cauſe to reply, and alſo for that there was a law, which enforced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13060:50"/>him to abſtaine from doing of any thing that might breed an offence, and whereby God likewiſe might bee nothing eſteemed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathen. Moreouer, we haue alſo another thing to conſider in that hee ſaith, <hi>(That hee haa lifted vp his hand vnto the Lord God most high, poſſeſsour of heauen and earth)</hi> Euen as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in like ſort vſed the ſame forme when he gaue the bleſsing. For, <hi>Abram</hi> was not contented to call the name of God to witnes, but he would alſo expreſſe what maner of God it was that hee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Wee know well inough that the world was at that time full of idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; yet euery man had the name of God in his mouth, euen as at this day the heathen will greatly brag that they honour God. For, the Turkes, Iewes, and Papiſts, wil not ſticke to abuſe this holy name: howbeit, it is but a polluting thereof, forſomuch as the Turkes worſhip that which they haue deuiſed of their owne braines, and ſo blaſpheme the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. For as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that hath not the Sonne, hath not the Father:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.23.</note> for, when as the Sonne is not honoured, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiueth that as a ſhame done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For, his liuely image muſt not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, neither muſt there be any deſpight done vnto his maieſtie. And therefore the Turkes worſhip nothing els but the diuell
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13060:51"/>vnder the name of God. And as for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, when as wee ſhall tell them that Ieſus Chriſt is our Aduocate, they can in no wiſe abide that, and yet dare they not altogither deny the holy ſcripture: for that is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and an offenſiue propoſition, becauſe men take occaſion from thence to ſay, that the men and women ſaints doo not make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion for vs. For, when we ſpeake of the free remiſsion of our ſins: and that we ought not to amuſe our ſelues about that idolatrous &amp; moſt abominable helliſh Maſſe of theirs: they are ſo madde withall, as that to them, it were a far greater offence once to ſweare by that Idoll the Maſſe, then to blaſpheme the name of God an hundreth times. Thus then we ſee, that the religion of the papiſts is moſt helliſh. And as for the Iewes, they doo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounce our Lorde and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Wee haue now alreadie ſhewed that the ſonne cannot be ſeperated from the father: and hauing reiected him, they haue ſhut themſelues cleane out of the doores, and forſaken the principall couenant which God made with them: to wit, becauſe they will not be partakers of the ſaluation which our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt bringeth with him. Thus we ſee how they abuſe the name of God in euerie condition. And ſo hath it been euen from <hi>Abram</hi> his time. We
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13060:51"/>ſee here then why hee calleth him the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and ſoone alter the moſt high God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would diſcerne him from the Idols of the Heathen. For the very Heathen right well knew, that there was a moſt high and excellent heauenly nature: but yet they had euer a deſire to haue a warren of pety gods after their owne will &amp; pleaſure. <hi>Abram</hi> was far from that, &amp; ſaith, that there is none but the eternal, which is the moſt high God. And withall he addeth, <hi>Poſseſsor of heauen &amp; earth:</hi> to ſhewe that God is not in heauen as fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall heads imagine, as to ſay that he ſitteth there, onely to behold that which is done in the world: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth himſelf that he once made all things: &amp; now letteth vs alone ſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping &amp; leaping here below vp &amp; downe like Frogs. But <hi>Abram</hi> ſheweth that he had not ſo blockiſh an opinion of his maieſty, but attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth vnto him an infinit power that ſpred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelf all ouer both henen &amp; earth. And this is done to make vs walke in his fear, and to aduertiſe vs that we are alwaies before his eies: &amp; that both our wits &amp; very thoughts ſhal come in a reckning before him: for God is not the poſſeſſor of heauen &amp; earth to eate &amp; feed, &amp; to do nothing els: he is not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make nothing but dumbe ſhews with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth himſelf alſo with his alone &amp; infinit maieſty, hauing in himſelf all bleſſednes.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:13060:52"/>
            <p>And although hee had neuer created anie thing, yet had he been therby no whit either leſſened nor encreaſed. And therefore when he is thus called, it is to ſhew, that he hath all things in ſubiection, and that we muſt all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere before him: and that hee ſo ruleth the world, as that nothing is hid from him: and that his office is ſo to ſound the thoughtes, and to examine all our wordes and deeds, as that being poſſeſſor both of heauen &amp; earth, he is alſo with all, our Lord and Iudge. Thus wee ſee why this title is impoſed vpon him, becauſe wee might walke here as before his maieſtie. We ſhould haue a wiſe catch of it to hunt after ſecret corners, ſeeing that all things ſhal come to light: and if ſo be we did thinke at this day to deceiue him with our cunning ſhifts, yet will it in the end light all vpon our owne heads. Againe, when as God is named to be poſſeſſor of heauen &amp; earth, we are aduertiſed to loue him as our nource Father, and to feare him as our Iudge. For, he is poſſeſſour of heauen and earth, becauſe hee is the chiefe ruler ouer vs, and muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before his iudgement ſeate, to receiue whatſoeuer we haue done in our bodies, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or ill. This is the poſſeſsion which he hath in heauen and earth. Now he poſſeſſeth not this for himſelfe onely: but bountifully of his infinite goodnes, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13060:52"/>vpon vs whatſoeuer we want, becauſe he hath created all things for our vſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot be but villainous ingratefull people, when as we heare the infinite power and goodnes of our God thus ſpoken of, and do by experience alſo feele the ſame, if wee endeuour not ourſelues eftſoons to loue him, and yeeld vnto him obedience. And vnder this word <hi>Heauen</hi> alſo, not only the benefites which we receiue by the Sun and Starres are ſet before vs, but the angels likewiſe are here put in amongſt, that we might learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues like vnto them. If then ſuch noble creatures as they are, haue none other regard but to apply themſelues vnto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: what ſhall become of vs poore wormes of the earth, or rather ſtraying wilde beaſtes, when as wee ſhall do nothing els but rebell againſt his maieſtie, in giuing our ſelues ouer vnto our filthy luſts &amp; appetites. Is it not too too great a ſhame for vs, to ſee the Angels ſo humble, as I haue already ſaid: &amp; our ſelues to be ſo proud &amp; rebellious? Here we ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſumme what wee are to remember, that whenſoeuer we ſhall ſpeake of God, we muſt alwaies ioyne his power with his eſſence: and not ſuffer this word, <hi>God,</hi> ſo lightly to paſſe through our lippes as many men do, but wee muſt know, that as hee is eternall, and hath made all thinges, that hee hath alſo reſerued

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E heard yeſterday, how <hi>Abram</hi> in making his moane vnto God, becauſe he had neuer a childe to be his heire, miſtruſted not the promiſe: as many of vs will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and grudge, if hee by and by yeeldeth not vnto vs that we deſire, and which beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs. Now <hi>Abram</hi> would not do ſo, but contented himſelfe that hee felt God to bee good and gracious vnto him, and that hee was his, both in life and in death. For he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer went further: but the thing which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13060:54"/>looked vnto, was, which way the promiſe might be accompliſhed. Now he had in very deed, promiſed the Redeemer: and for that cauſe was he ſo earneſt to haue iſſue: but not in any worldly reſpect as we haue heretofore ſaid, but becauſe he could not otherwiſe be perſuaded that God loued him. And this is the rather confirmed by the promiſe which God made him: for hee granted him his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt euen at the very firſt, &amp; reproued him alſo for his doubting thereof, becauſe God had giuen him his word before. For he ſaid (<hi>HE SHALL NOT BE THINE HEIRE,</hi> but one ſhall come out of thine own bowels, he ſhalbe thine heire. No doubt of it, God many times graunteth vnto men their vnaduiſed requeſtes: but we ſee heere, that he aduowed his ſeruant <hi>Abrams</hi> deſire. And it was not without cauſe, forſomuch as he craued nothing els but to haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ratified by that meane that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: but becauſe he was ouer haſtie, God ſaid vnto him, no: and repulſed his ouer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement hotte deſire, not but that hee might lawfully require to ſee the Redeemer: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee muſt alwaies keepe a meaſure, and how euer it is, reſt vppon the prouidence of God: becauſe he knoweth when it is beſt to do vs good. And therfore we muſt patiently abide his leiſure, for, as the holie ſcripture
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13060:54"/>ſaith, it is the verie propertie of faith ſo to do. To be ſhort, we ſee here how God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Abrams</hi> requeſt in deſiring to haue iſſue liked him well, conſidering to what end he deſired it. And becauſe hee ſaw his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hee would needes adde thereunto ſome confirmation: and brought him out of his Tent, and ſaid vnto him, <hi>(LOOKE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>P NOW VNTO HEAVEN: and tell the Starres if thou be able, ſo ſhall thy ſeede bee.)</hi> But if there bee ſuch an infinite number of Starres, as that they ſhall dazle thine eyes when thou wouldeſt looke vpon them to tell them: euen ſo ſhall thy ſeede, after ſuch an vnaccuſtomed ſort bee multiplied, as that men ſhall wonder thereat, by reaſon of the ſtrangenes thereof. Now as we haue alreadie handled in the twelfth Chapter, this place cannot otherwiſe bee interpreted, but that Ieſus Chriſt is the head, and direct line as it were of the ſeed of <hi>Abram:</hi> for we ſhall heare hereafter, that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was begotten, and yet for all that the promiſe was not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: notwithſtanding that he was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſonne of <hi>Abram,</hi> but not (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) the naturall ſonne of the promiſe. And therefore wee muſt not take this here to be a carnall generation: but looke higher, to wit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat</hi> 4.23.</note> we muſt diſcerne betweene the children of <hi>Abram</hi> as they are in their eſtate and order,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13060:55"/>whereby they are knowne and aduowed to be the children of God, and thoſe that bee baſtardes, although they come of his race. For although <hi>Iſaac</hi> begot <hi>Eſaw</hi> and <hi>Iaakob:</hi> and <hi>Eſaw</hi> was the firſt borne and both of one woman: yet for all that, was <hi>Eſaw</hi> turned quite and cleane out of the doores. Now, no man could perceiue the diuerſitie why (of theſe two children) <hi>Iaakob</hi> ſhould bee preferred before the other: conſideryng that they were conceiued both at one time, borne both at once, and beſides, <hi>Eſaw</hi> the firſt borne. And why then is hee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a ſtraunger, and to haue neyther roome nor place in this ſpirituall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which GOD promiſed to <hi>Abrams</hi> poſteritie? The reaſon is, becauſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was taken from him, and giuen to his yoonger brother: but yet he had the right of the firſt borne. Wee ſee heére then in ſumme, that if wee take all thoſe to bee the ſeede of <hi>Abram</hi> which come of him as concerning the fleſh, wee ſhall finde nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon nor yet ſound grounde heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Againe, although God adopted all the poſteritie of <hi>Iaakob,</hi> yet was the greateſt part of them made ſtraungers vnto him. Wee ſee alſo why GOD ſo oftentimes diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed them by his Prophets. Wherefore there muſt needes bee a chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13060:55"/>one of this ſeede, or elſe we ſhall neuer bee able to haue the truth of this promiſe. No doubt of it they ſpake not onelye of Ieſus Chriſt, as ſome haue ouer rawlye done: but this order alſo muſt bee kept, that is, wee muſt ſet Ieſus Chriſt before vs, and bee conioyned togither in him: and then this vnion will cauſe vs to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and reputed the children of <hi>Abram.</hi> Wherefore there could bee no ſuch ſeede as is here ſpoken of, except Ieſus Chriſt were the head, and wee vnited to him as members of his bodie, and thereby to be of the houſe of God, and ſo conſequently of the houſe of <hi>Abram.</hi> Now we ſee that God made this ſeede to ſeeme ſmall, that he might encreaſe it. And this is a kinde of dealing which ſeemeth ſtraunge vnto the world: but wee muſt all be brought to be acquainted with this. For according to the common opinion, when wee ſpeake of ſeed, the firſt borne muſt bring in the ſecond, and ſo all the reſt: one after another. Now, God dealeth otherwiſe, when as hee will haue ſeede: yea ſuch a great number and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as that it would make a man aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to ſee it, and GOD ſo cutteth off, abridgeth, and diminiſheth it, as that in time it commeth ſo to paſſe, that it ſeemeth to bee as it were quyte and cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13060:56"/>and no whit left thereof, as in the tenth Chapter of his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he ſaith: but hee doth it becauſe hee would within a while after multiply the ſame beyond all mans reaſon and expectation: to the ende his wonderfull power might bee the better knowne, and all men thereby bee forceably driuen to worſhip him. For although there deſcended of <hi>Abram</hi> maruellous many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as firſt of all, the twelue Tribes, beſides the Iſmaelites and the Idumeans: yet was there neuer ſo great a multitude in his houſe, as came by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For they which apperteined not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abram</hi> as concerning the fleſh, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding made his houſhold meney. For as we ſhall hereafter ſee, he was the father of all the faithfull in generall. Wherefore the poſteritie of <hi>Abram</hi> was far greater, when as hee leſſened that which deſcended of him concerning the fleſh, then if he had let them all to haue remained and continued ſtill. We are therefore heereby admoniſhed, not to meaſure the workes of God according to our opinion and fantaſie: but giue place vnto his incomprehenſible power, and be contented when he hath ſaid the word, that he is of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer able to accompliſh the ſame, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhall be more at large handled. In that God brought <hi>Abram</hi> out of his Tent where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13060:56"/>he dwelt, and made him looke vp to heauen to behold the Starres thereof, wee ſhall not need to buſie our ſelues about this childiſh ſubtiltie, as how God compareth the church to the Starres, becauſe we are citizens of the kingdome of heauen, dwelling here vppon earth as ſtrangers, alwaies trauelling further. For this is not the meaning of the place. And alſo where wee haue heeretofore ſpoken of duſt, ſome men in a ſpeculatiue ſort haue thought the Church to bee there ſet downe vnder the image and figure of duſt, and that the world ſhuld make no account of it: theſe are nothing els but more trifling toyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſound ground. But we ſee why God ſet before his ſeruant <hi>Abram</hi> the Starres of heauen, to looke vppon them: euen that hee might behold his power, &amp; not by his owne diſcourſe &amp; reaſon iudge of the truth of this promiſe, which in the naturall conceipt of man was incredible. For we ſhall neuer haue faith vntill ſuch time as this fault bee amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and corrected: to wit, to leaue our owne naturall iudgement, and caſt away all our owne wiſedome, that we might attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone the honor due vnto him. Now let vs ſee if this be not a moſt notable &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glaſſe of the infinit power of God, to behold this infinite multitude of Starres of heauen created in a moment. And we ſee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13060:57"/>alſo in the Pſalme why this miracle is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.4.</note> 
               <hi>That it is he that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the multitude of the Stars, &amp; giueth them their names:</hi> that is to ſay, it is hee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſubiect vnto him and to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. And therefore when we open our eyes to behold the Stars, we muſt by and by looke vnto their creation: for in a minute, aſſoone as God had ſpoken the word, behold the heauen was full of this army royall, as the ſcripture calleth them. Thus we ſee that the heauenly hoſtes were created in a minute, and are continually obedient vnto his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. We ſee that all the Stars keep their due courſe and compaſſe, and although their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution be euery way great, &amp; that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets may remoue the firmament, &amp; may be all mixed togither: yet wee ſee that they are all ſo directed, as that wee are enforced to wonder at it. Seeing then it is ſo, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though this glaſſe was let before the eyes of <hi>Abram:</hi> for therein hee might haue thus concluded, ſith GOD in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment furniſhed all heauen with Starres, where before was not one: may hee not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo furniſh not onely my houſe, but an whole Country, yea many Countries, whenſoeuer hee meaneth to beſtowe poſteritie vppon mee? For his power is no whit leſſened: for hee did not onely create the world at once,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13060:57"/>but after hee had created it, hee miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerued the ſame continually. And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Abram</hi> had a ſure and certaine token, and as it were a pawne giuen him. And heerein wee ſee, that God knew ſome infirmitie to bee in him: not that hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted that which God had promiſed, but becauſe hee was a man, he could not keepe himſelfe within ſuch compaſſe, but that hee would needs aske the queſtion how it could be poſsible that in his, ſeede all the nations of the world ſhould be bleſſed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe his faith was ſomewhat weake, as yeſterday wee heard: wee ſee why God after this manner added vnto him this aide and helpe. And ſo, wee haue to note in this place as in all the reſt, that God ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in all our weakeneſſe. Not that we ſhould flatter pur ſelues: for wee are to fight againſt all our paſsions, &amp; againſt al our euill thoughtes and affections, to giue place vnto the truth of God, and to hold it for certaine and infallible: howbeit whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee doo, it cannot bee but that it muſt in ſome ſort bee weake: and although wee know not our owne faults, yet God knoweth them well inough. How then ſhould we do, if hee of his infinite goodnes ſpared vs not? Here then we ſee what wee are to conſider from this Text, where it is ſayde, That
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13060:58"/>God confirmed <hi>Abram</hi> both in his word and in his promiſe, as we might daily ſee the like in our ſelues, if wee were not blinded in our owne malice: becauſe we regard not ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and diligently the workes of God as we ſhould. But if we made benefite of all the meanes which God offreth vs, that we might aſſure our ſelues of his promiſes, wee ſhould ſee that where he ſpared his ſeruant <hi>Abram,</hi> as hee knoweth vs to be an hundreth times more weake, that he will not for his part for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get any thing which may confirme our faith. Now heereupon, <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth and ſaith, <hi>THAT ABRAM BELEE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ED GOD, and it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes.</hi>) Here wee ſee a Text plaine inough, and at the firſt ſight not greatly to bee ſtood vpon, and yet the Iewes are ſo blockiſh and blinde, as that they know not what it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. And amongſt Chriſtians alſo, hardlie ſhall we find one amonſt an hundreth, which vnderſtandeth onely the meaning of theſe words. For if theſe three or foure words were truly vnderſtood <hi>(THAT ABRAM BELEEVED, and it was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes)</hi> without doubt it wold ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole ſtate of Popery: all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions which at this day beare ſway ſhould ceaſe: and all controuerſies now in diſpute be appaiſed. For this is the key which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13060:58"/>what ſoeuer is requiſite for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this is the meanes to decide all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies: this is the foundation of all true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: to be ſhort, this is it that ſetteth open the heauens vnto vs, if we can comprehend that which <hi>Moſes</hi> heere in a word ſetteth downe vnto vs. And ſo much the more are we to deteſt theſe dogges that are ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, as to dare to obſcure ſuch a maruellous cleare light: of which ſort are they which ſay that <hi>Abram</hi> was taken to be a wiſe man, and that, that was a vertue in him to beleeue God: now we ſhould in verie deed abhorre theſe dogges. For theſe are the moſt wicked blaſphemies that Sathan is anyway poſsibly able to ſpue out. Now as for the Iewes, wee are no whit to maruell at them, becauſe they had no expoſitor. No doubt of it, God migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſhined in the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> howbeit they had a vale before them, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.14.15.</note> and therfore they paſſed ouer theſe words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking of them what they imported. But they which profeſſe themſelues to bee Chriſtians, &amp; are able to ſhew the meaning hereof by the authoritie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.3. Gala. <hi>3.6.</hi>
               </note> when theſe I ſay ſhall manifeſtly ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and like maſtiue curres fight ſo impudently as we ſee them do: what reaſon haue they for it? I do not now ſpeake of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but I ſpeake of theſe diuelliſh ſpirites,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13060:59"/>which will bee called Chriſtians, and will alſo with open mouth make profeſsion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet notwithſtanding are ſuch as bee farre worſe then the Papiſts, for they neuer went thus farre in Popery, to ſaie that thoſe which were damned and curſed before God, could any way poſsibly bee ſaued without faith. The very Papiſts themſelues wil grant this: and theſe dogs do vtterly reiect &amp; raze out euerie whit of this, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els ſaid but this: So <hi>Abram,</hi> a very wiſe man, and this was the vertue in him which made him beleeue God. Here we ſee a ſort of villaines that would be accounted to be famous men, and bee called Maiſters and Doctours, and yet are ſo madde and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with furie, as that they would vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrow all. Wherefore wee are to bee ſo much the more attentiue and heedfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is here conteined. For on the one ſide, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>THAT ABRAM BELEE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ED GOD,</hi> and on the other ſide he addeth, that this beleefe or faith, was imputed to him for righteouſnes. And firſt we are here to define what <hi>BELEEFE</hi> is: for otherwiſe wee ſhall make nothing of it. And here we ſee how the Papiſts are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in their errors: for although they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in part, that wee are iuſtified by faith, yet can they not fully conceiue and accept
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13060:59"/>it. And what is the reaſon? Forſooth, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vnderſtand not what this word Faith or Beleefe meaneth. And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding hereof, we muſt ioyn ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betweene faith and the promiſe. For a man may ſing well with one voice alone: howbeit there will bee no perfect melodie, without ther be many tunable voices agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing togither. Euen ſo is it with faith: for, if the word of God goeth not before, and faith agree therwith, there will neuer be any good hermony. For the word of God &amp; faith, are two things which cannot be ſeperated. For ſo a man may ſpeake exceeding much of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, and yet notwithſtanding it ſhould be (as we ſay) like an hie Almaine, a barbarous kinde of ſpeech, as it is amongſt the Papiſts, vntill ſuch time as wee bee come vnto this point, that God muſt ſpeak, &amp; we muſt haue our eares open &amp; attentiue to obey and giue place vnto his word. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Belief? It is to receiue whatſoeuer is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs from the mouth of god, with ſuch reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as that we hold it to be certain &amp; ſure. And yet wee muſt do more then all this: for God wil ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak in ſuch ſort, as that we ſhal be no whit the better to heare him. We haue ſeene heretofore that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpake vnto <hi>Cayn,</hi> and asked him where his brother was <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cain</hi> right well knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt anſwer before his iudge
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13060:60"/>in deſpite of his teeth, neuertheles he grom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and was angry, ſaying: who made mee my brothers keeper? <hi>Adam</hi> alſo heard the like voice, where art thou? howbeit hee was ſo afeard as that he would haue hid himſelf, and haue been glad to haue found ſome bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles dungeon to haue fled from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Wherefore it is not inough for vs to heare the word of God with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that it deſerueth: but it muſt alſo be therewithall quallified: that is to ſay, it muſt be ſuch a ſure and certaine word vnto vs as may make vs approach neere vnto God, and make vs partakers of his bountie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and not to doubt but that he wil be our Father and Sauiour, and ſo therupon may be bold to call vppon him, and hold our ſelues for his children, &amp; flie vnto him for ſuccour and aide. Thus we ſee how <hi>Abram</hi> beleeued: it was no fantaſticall opinion which hee had conceiued in his braine:<note place="margin">Ro. 10.17</note> for Faith (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) commeth by hearing, and by hearing of the word of God. <hi>Abram</hi> then heard and was taught before he beleeued. Neither was hee inſtructed by anie creature or mortall man, but knew right well that it was GOD which called him to be one of his children. Now this had not been inough, as wee haue already ſayd, but <hi>Abram</hi> heard theſe words: <hi>I AM THINE EXCEEDING</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>15.</hi> 1</note>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:13060:60"/>
               <hi>GREAT REWARD. I AM THY DEFENCE: FEARE NOT, FOR I AM THE ALMIGHTIE GOD WHICH HATH BRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT THEE O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T OF CHALDE, AND O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T OF HER OF THE CHALDEANS,</hi> and as hereafter wee ſhall ſee, and as we haue already partly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it in the twelfth Chapter, That <hi>Abram</hi> beleeued not God in hearing I cannot tell what, and which apperteined nothing vnto him, or to heare ſome perticuler ſpeech: but he beleeued God, when as hee verily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that hee was kept and reſerued to be an inheritour of the kingdome of heauen. Thus we ſee what his faith was. But for the better vnderſtanding hereof, wee are to note, that there is a perticuler faith, and a faith alſo which comprehendeth whatſoeuer is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for our ſaluation. As if God ſhould now threaten vs, it might ſo fall out as that it would moue and touch the hearts of verie hypocrites &amp; contemners of his word. Now this is ſaid to be a perticuler faith. For how many do we ſee, when as the iudgements of God are ſet before them, to be amazed, and ſeared as it were within with an hotte yron, looking on euery ſide when they ſhould fall vpon them: and why ſo. Forſooth, the reaſon is, that although they would ſtomacke and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13060:61"/>brag out the matter neuer ſo much, yet ſhall they bee driuen to acknowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they ſhal neuer be able to eſcape the heauenly iudge his handes. Theſe men then, I ſay, haue a certain kind of faith, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is but in part: and it is ſuch a peece of faith, as will do them no good: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you ſhall ſee ſome men aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vppon a perticuler promiſe, when as they are in daunger: for if a man ſhall come and ſaie vnto them, that God will haue compaſsion vppon them, they can lyke verie well of this ſpeech, howbeit it is but onelie in an expectation. Againe, we ſhall ſee another man extreemly ſicke, or ſuffering great pouertie: and it may be that hee will call vppon GOD for aide. Another man may bee brought vnto ſuch an extreame daunger, as that hee is as it were at his wittes ende: yet hee hath a good hope, becauſe hee knoweth that God can helpe him. Nowe theſe are but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler beleefes, and can not ſaue vs, and ſo conſequently, not iuſtefie vs: but when wee ſhall aſſure our ſelues of our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein conſiſteth all our felicitie: this is it that maketh vs hope that GOD will bee our Father vnto the ende: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath promiſed that his children ſhall not periſh: and that wee maye call
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13060:61"/>vppon him as vppon our GOD, for our vndoubted ſaluation. Now then when as wee ſhall haue this promiſe by which God vniteth vs vnto him ſelfe, and ſo allyeth him ſelfe vnto vs, as that wee neuer doubt that hee will forget vs: this then is ſuch a faith as comprehendeth within it all the promiſes.<note place="margin">1. Timo. 4.8.</note> For (as Shint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith) <hi>The feare of God which proceedeth from Fayth, hath not onelie the promiſes of the life now, but of the Life to come.</hi> For wee maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all thinges ſhall goe well with vs, if ſo be that God fauoureth vs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of vs.</p>
            <p>Heere then wee ſee what wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as concernyng this worde Beleefe. <hi>(Abram then beleeued GOD)</hi> that is to ſaie, <hi>Abram</hi> receiued the promiſe, by which GOD certefied him, that hee was his Sauiour, that hee embraced our Lord Ieſus Chriſt that was offered him, by whom hee knew wee were reconciled vnto God, although wee were woorthie to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted his enemies, and to haue mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall warres made vppon vs, by reaſon of our ſinne and corruption. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abram</hi> is beholden vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and was fully perſwaded that that was the verie bond, by which wee are conioyned and vnited vnto God, as that we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13060:62"/>are partakers both of his life and alſo of all his benefites. Here then we ſee <hi>Abrams</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, to the end we take it not ſo leanly and ſparingly as the Papiſts do. Wee ſee now in ſumme, that we ſhal neuer be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what this word Faith and Beliefe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, except we come to this melodie of the Promiſe, and of the Receipt thereof. And why is it that God ſo often ſaith by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>I will call you my people,</hi> and you ſhall ſay, <hi>Thou art our God?</hi> Thus we ſee why God firſt ſpeaketh: and it belongeth to him ſo to do: for, what a raſh part were it of me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate my ſelfe to come vnto God, and to call him my Father, who am no better then a worme crawling vppon the earth, no nor ſo good neither: but rather ſinne and horrible infection to be condemned for euer, whom Sathan by nature poſſeſſeth, &amp; whoſe bond-ſlaues wee all are: and yet call God my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yea, to ſee mee vſurpe and take vppon me ſuch honour as the verie Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as of themſelues, are not worthie? But when he hath once pronounced this ſaying, <hi>I am thy Father:</hi> now it is no more curſed bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and preſumption to take our ſelues to be of the number of his children, but an holy confidence and truſt, by which we ratefie his truth. And this is the greateſt honour that we can do him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he hath ſaid the word,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13060:62"/>to content our ſelues therwith and reſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Thus I ſay, wee ſee what true beleefe is, euen that which is here ſhewed vnto vs by the example and inſtruction in <hi>Abram.</hi> Now it is ſaid, that that was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes: and that it was God that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the ſame vnto him. We are now to ſet downe what this word <hi>Impute,</hi> and this word <hi>Righteouſnes,</hi> ſignifieth, in comprehending al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo therewith the name of God. This word <hi>Impute,</hi> importeth as much, as to allow or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. As when a man oweth any thing, if he hath payd it, he is allowed it. Or if when his debtes are ſet downe he ſheweth, that he hath payd this, and payd that, well hee is ſo allowed it, as that he is diſcharged of it, and hath his quietus eſt. Now in our naturall French language this word <hi>Impute,</hi> is alwaies taken in ill part. For we neuer ſay, that anie vertue is imputed to a man: for the word Impute importeth a matter of reproach, or of a fault done: for wee will ſay, this matter will be imputed vnto him as a fault. Now the ſcripture vſeth this word in common, as well in good part as in ill, that is, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth righteouſnes, and imputeth not ſinnes. And therefore when it is ſaid, that Faith was imputed vnto <hi>Abram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is as much to ſaie, as that it ouerthroweth whatſoeuer might come as from him. Neuertheles we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13060:63"/>be able to vnderſtand the valure and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of this word, but by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For when it is ſayd, that ſinnes are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, it is as much to ſaie, as our ſinnes are regiſtred in the Recordes, and we ſtand in them condemned, ſo that there remaineth nothing but iudgement and execution. And therefore accurſed are wee ſo long as God imputeth vnto vs our treſpaſſes. For it is ſayd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſsed are they to whome the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not their ſinnes.</hi> And ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, accurſed is the whole world, when as GOD ſhall proceede as a Iudge againſt it, and impannell a Iewrie of life and death thereon. What then is the meaning of theſe wordes: <hi>That Faith is imputed for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?</hi> It is this, that God putteth it into an allowance for vs, ſo that thereby our ſinnes are not imputed vnto vs: for the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee vnderſtood without the other: and therefore the imputing of righteouſnes, is the cauſe why our ſinnes are no more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs to iudge and condemne vs. For the imputing of righteouſnes, is in ſumme, meere pardon and abſolution. Here now we ſee the right meaning of this word. And now let vs ſee what this word righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes importeth: For this word is not a vertue, as if a man ſhould ſaie him to be iuſt and righteous which gouerneth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13060:63"/>out reproach. But the righteouſnes which is here ſpoken of, is a fauour and grace which God beſtoweth vppon vs, becauſe he would haue mercie vppon vs, and of his meere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie bee reconciled vnto vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this righteouſnes which <hi>Moſes</hi> heere ſpeaketh of, is not a qualitie that wee are to looke for in men: but a fauour which God beareth vnto vs, when as it pleaſeth him to burie our ſinnes in the bottomleſſe ſea of his mercy, and not once looke after them again: and accept of vs as if wee had abſolutely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the law. And why is that? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is righteous, and his perfect righteouſnes is imputed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vnto vs. And as he is ours by the gift of God his Father, and daily offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo vnto vs by the Ghoſpell, euen ſo communicateth he his righteouſnes vnto vs, when as we poſſeſſe and enioy him. And God vouchſafeth it euen as well as if wee our ſelues had wrought the ſame in our owne perſons. And thus we ſee what the meaning of this word Righteouſnes is: for now I do but vnfold theſe things by litle and litle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee meane heereafter to amplifie the true ſummarie of the whole.</p>
            <p>Wee will nowe come to ſpeake of the name of GOD: For men may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vs to bee righteous, by reaſon of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13060:64"/>ſome apparance and outward ſhewe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vertue, which they may thinke to be in vs, and to like well of vs, and ſo wee ſhall haue a great number of imputations, that is to ſay, verie Catalogues of righteouſnes and imputations, we ſhall be abſolued, yea and alſo exceedingly commended and praiſed, when as they ſhal ſee vs to haue walked god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; vertuouſly: and yet all this is nothing. And therefore we muſt come vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly iudge as it is ſaid of him. And ſee why <hi>Moſes</hi> namely expreſſeth, <hi>That God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Abrams beleefe for righteouſnes.</hi> Now if all the world had ſo eſteemed and liked of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brams</hi> faith, and had canozized him, as a man would ſay, as if he had been an Angell, it had vaniſhed away all like ſmoke, but it is God that ſpake it, euen hee who is a competent iudge, and to whom belongeth thé giuing of ſentence, either of ſaluation or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore when God abſolued <hi>Abram</hi> after that maner, and acknowledged &amp; held him for righteous, this we ſee was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point. And therefore we now ſee that <hi>Abram</hi> was iuſtified by Faith. Whereuppon S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it followeth, that he could no way deſerue to be righteous by his workes, and that he brought nothing with him of his owne why God ſhould like of him, but that he freely receiued him and made him one of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13060:64"/>his children. And in deed S. <hi>Paul</hi> when hee meaneth to ſpeake of free iuſtification, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here this way with himſelf, to ſhew that there is none other hope to bee ſaued, but by the meere mercie and goodnes or God, becauſe hee pardoneth our ſinnes, that wee might pleaſe him. Wherefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> entreth into this argument, hee fetcheth this Theme from <hi>Abram:</hi> for hee preſuppoſeth that which is true, that there are not ſundrie waies to be iuſtified before God, and that there is but one onely rule. And therefore if <hi>Abram</hi> was iuſtified by faith, we al alſo muſt ſo be without exception. Moreouer, if there could be found in any mortall man that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which might merite: no doubt of it, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> ſurmounted all others therin. We haue alreadie heard how he forſooke the country, wherin he was borne, how he renounced him ſelfe and all his humane and naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how he abſolutely obeyed God. We haue alſo heard of his patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly he aboad in al his temptations, how he perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the end, in the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherunto god had called him: to be ſhort, we haue heard that he failed in nothing. Now, we that are here are far from this perfection. How then dareth he whatſoeuer he is, be once ſo bold as to vant himſelf to be able to appeare righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God through his owne merits,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13060:65"/>conſidering that <hi>Abram</hi> was neuer able to doo it? howbeit, let that ſuffice vs which I haue alreadie ſpoken of, to wit, that there is but one onelie rule that can make vs pleaſe God: and that is it which is heere ſet downe vnto vs in the perſon of <hi>Abram.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wee muſt thus conclude alſo, that ſith <hi>Abram</hi> was iuſtified by beleeuing God, that our workes can no whit auaile vs to be lyked of God, and to make a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hope which we muſt haue of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation: it is God that muſt giue vs all in all, and not wee once preſume to bring any thing with vs of our owne towardes it. We will ſpeake hereof more at large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but in the meane while wee will vſe the eaſieſt way of proceeding herein we poſsibly may. Here now we ſee as I haue already ſaid, our A. B. C. And this is the perfection of all our wiſedome. And will not this be inough when as we haue learned the principle and ground of our faith? and vnderſtood what entrance we ſhould haue for our profit in the ſchoole of God? which is the principall key of all the Goſpell, and which leadeth vs euen to the true end, wherby we may know which way we may walke aright, and attaine vnto the inheritance which God hath layd vp in ſtore for vs. And therefore when as wee ſhall perceiue that this place leadeth vs
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13060:65"/>thereunto, no doubt of it we ſhould, either ought to looke vnto it, or els we ſhalbe moſt villainouſly vnthankfull. Now we haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſet downe theſe things moſt familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily, ſo that there is not ſo yoong a childe as cannot but taſte therof. Let vs now then come to the point which I haue a ready touched, which is, that <hi>Abram</hi> brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with him whatſoeuer, why God ſhould accent him: but reſted wholly vppon the meere grace and liberalitie conteined in the promiſe. Let vs now then hereuppon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of what time it is ſpoken. Certaine it is that <hi>Abram</hi> had ſerued God ſo long, as that a man would haue thought hee might now haue been very well diſcharged and freed, in the common &amp; ordinary iudgement of man. And therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that <hi>Abram</hi> was all his life long iuſtified by the only meane of Faith. Now this would ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me ſomewhat obſcure and darke if wee ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>not make it more plaine and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. And it ſhall bee made the plainer and minifeſter in giuing light vnto the truth by the leaſinges of Poperie, and by the errors wherewith all thoſe infernall ſchooles are corrupted and infected. I haue alreadie ſaid, that the Papiſts wil eaſily inough grant, that without faith we can no waies pleaſe God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or be in his fauor. Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce granted this principle, that wee are all
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13060:66"/>accurſed in <hi>Adam:</hi> then may they as wel ſay, that we muſt receiue the firſt grace from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. That is to ſay, that ſeeing we are plunged in the bottomles pit of deſtruction through originall ſinne, Ieſus Chriſt muſt needs fetch vs out of it. Now, from hence they draw a falſe and pernicious doctrine, by which they corrupt and falſifie <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> alſo moſt excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For they ſay, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes which they call <hi>Initiall</hi> commeth of faith, and of pure and ſimple Faith: but that afterward, we muſt be partly iuſtified by our workes. Now this is ſomewhat darke to bee vnderſtood, howbeit I will ſo ſet it downe, as that euerie one ſhall be able to vnderſtand it. This word then <hi>Initiall,</hi> is as much to ſay as Beginning, and it is a word that is taken from the Latine: for it is as much to ſay, as the beginning righteouſnes in a pure faith. Wherfore the Papiſts will confeſſe that God taketh vs to be his enimies, and doth accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe vs: becauſe we are nothing els but as it were a moſt filthie and ſtinking dunghill: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d therefore by reaſon of our ſtaines and poll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he cannot chuſe but reiect vs. They wil grant al this: and it ſeemeth at the firſt ſight to be the way to humble vs. And beſides, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they ſhew no les but that it is Ieſus Chriſt that muſt help &amp; remedie whatſoeuer wants
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13060:66"/>we haue, to hold vs by the hand, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs vnto God his Father. Now, when they haue brought vs to this, then they tel vs that we muſt in part merite to be righteous, and that muſt forſooth be done, though the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of our workes: ſo as they ſet downe free righteouſnes all at once, when as we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the Church by Baptiſme, which is inough: &amp; ſo we ſee that Ieſus Chriſt hath done his part. And yet in verie deed they adde and ſay, that we cannot be abſolutely righteous: but they ſhall in ſpite of their teeth feele it, and experience alſo will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them, that they are many waies behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to God. But ſoone after they come in &amp; ſay, that they haue their ſatisfactions, and do reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence God otherwiſe, in doing of things which they are not commanded, as faſting on ſuch a day, abſtaining from eating of fleſh another day, going on pylgrimage, cauſing Maſſes to be ſung, and ſuch other like try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling toyes, which they make a mountaine of to acquite themſelues before God. Thus we ſee how they beſtow themſelues all their life long, to be made righteous by their workes and merits, being once iuſtified by faith, that is to ſay, being brought into the way. They confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt openeth the doore vnto them: but they ſaie, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues muſt enter in at it and performe the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13060:67"/>voyage. There is in them alſo another error: for they thinke that when they do any good deed, although there be much euil amongſt, yet that this good deed is accounted of, and this they call partiall righteouſnes. And thus they make a patched and peeced righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, taking here and there a peece, rouing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout &amp; making ſuch a medley, as is nothing worth, but a confuſed matter or no vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. They ſay alſo that we are firſt iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the meere grace of Ieſus Chriſt, and next, by Faith: and then by our workes and partly by our ſatisfactions, which ſerue to appaiſe the wrath of God againſt vs, and to acquit vs of all the ſinnes wherof we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And this is the opinion of the Papiſts. Let vs now ſee when it was that <hi>Abram</hi> was iuſtified, as we haue alreadie touched it: hee was a man indued with all vertues, a man that had forſaken him ſelfe, wholy to pleaſe God. And therefore it might ſeeme that hee mought haue had ſome righteouſnes in him, if any were to bee founde in anie liuing creature: and yet for all that, his faith was imputed vnto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that he had no workes in him to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelfe. And when, I pray you, had hee none in him? For ſooth euen then, when hee had had ſo notably trauelled &amp; endured ſuch
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13060:67"/>trials, as that hee might haue been the verie patterne as it were of all Angellike vertues, for his chaſtitie, for his patience, for his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towardes God, for his pietie: to bee ſhort, he mortified all his affections, that he might frame himſelfe wholly vnto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God. And when he had done all this, yet (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) had he nothing whereof to glory: but muſt ſtop his mouth, vntill ſuch time as hee was iuſtified by faith, and therfore we ſee by the circumſtance of the time, that the righteouſnes of faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee now ſpeake, is not ſuch as the Papiſts imagine. But it is as much as if the ſcripture ſhould ſay, ſeeing then that we are poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinners engaged vnto God, and vnder the condemnation of eternall death: it muſt needs be that hee muſt accept of vs by ſome other mean, that is, he muſt not examin what we are, nor yet looke to finde any thing in vs which any way might make vs acceptable in his ſight, but hold vs to be righteous, becauſe it is his good pleaſure ſo to doo, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we reſt vpon his promiſes, by which he hath preuented vs. Here wee ſee the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes that endureth, which extendeth it ſelfe both in life and death. But we are now to ſet downe theſe thinges more largely and plainly. And firſt wee are to remember that which earſt I touched, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee muſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13060:68"/>ſeeke for our righteouſnes els where then in our ſelues, becauſe there is none in vs. And ſee why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo greatly inſiſteth and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the curſe of mankinde, when as he would driue vs to this point, that God freely juſtifieth vs: for there hee ſheweth that the Heathen are alſo condemned, although they haue neither lawe, ſcripture, nor Prophets, and ſaith, that they are of themſelues alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die damned, and need neuer go any farther. For God hath manifeſted himſelfe to all in general, in giuing vs eyes to behold the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. Now we ſee that we ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſuppreſſe the glory which we ought moſt manifeſtly to behold. And therfore we muſt conclude, that we are all yea moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull ſacrilegers, becauſe we robbe God of that honour that is due vnto him. As for thoſe that are vnder the law, there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condemnation vppon their heades, for they ſinne wittingly, becauſe they know the will of God plainly manifeſted vnto them. Heere then wee ſee all mankinde encloſed within the curſe. Let therefore, ſaith he, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mouth be ſtopped, and be ſtill: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee bringeth in many places of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſhewe, that God looked vppon the children of men, and found not one good, but all corrupt: that is to ſay, they were ſo wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp in their iniquities, as that they were
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13060:68"/>to be abhorred. Here then we ſee what we are to note in the firſt place, that is, wee are hereby to vnderſtand what our ſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, vntill ſuch time as God commeth vnto vs to haue mercie vpon vs, and looketh after vs when as we are plunged in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles pit of hell. Thus then we ſee at what ende we muſt begin, if we will rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how and wherefore we are iuſtified by Faith. But this cannot now be followed as it ſhould, and therefore we wil let it alone vntill our next exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now then fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God and mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ieſus Chriſt, in acknowledging our manifold ſinnes and iniquities, whereby we are moſt engaged and bound vnto him, and for which wee ought to be vtterly confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our ſelues. And although we be caſt down into ſuch a bottomles depth of diſpair, yet let vs not ceaſe to lift vp our heades and hands vnto his maieſtie, ſeeing he hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vs ſuch fauour as to looke after vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would gather vs vnto himſelfe, and becauſe alſo that Ieſus Chriſt deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell to bring vs out thereof, and lead vs vnto the kingdome of heauen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this bee ſo printed in our hearts, as that wee may be truely lifted vp by faith to call vpon this good God, who hath adopted
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13060:69"/>vs for his children, and wholly reſt vppon him. And let vs farther beſeech him to grant vs the grace ſo to walke, as that his adoption be not vaine nor vnprofitable in vs, but that it may ſhew the fruites thereof, inſomuch as we ſhall bee gouerned by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, accordingly as hee hath incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated vs into himſelfe.</p>

And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as we know that aright, we ſhal neuer feele what it is to obtaine the fauour and mercie of God. Here then wee ſee the true foundation whereon to build, which is, that after wee haue rightly examined what we are, and finding nothing in our ſelues but vtter ſhame and confuſion, we might ſeeke for the remedie els where. And for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſuch a triall, wee muſt of neceſsitie come to the ſcriptures. In verie deed if euery man did conſider himſelfe without flatterie, we ſhould iudge our ſelues without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther triall. We ſhould not need to vſe long circumſtances about the finding out of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13060:70"/>inough againſt our ſelues: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs hath an hotte burning skarre in himſelfe, to imprint the curſe of God vpon vs. But becauſe wee are ſubiect to hide our ſinnes and bury them, therfore hath God ſet his word before vs as a glaſſe, that we might therein behold how to learne to iudge our ſelues thereby, and not after our owne fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. And although wee perceiue not at the firſt our owne miſerie, yet when we ſhall ſee the ſame laid open by the word of God, that were inough wholly to confound vs. For if euerie one of vs ſhould truſt to his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we would then be all righteous.

               <hi>That he loueth thoſe which deale liberally with him, and come with a free affection.</hi> Here then we ſee that our works how glorious ſoeuer they ſeeme to be either in our owne eyes or in the eyes of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are but dung and filth before God, vntil ſuch time as hee hath cleanſed vs of our ſports and vncleannes, and beſides hath ſhewed vs, what marke he would haue vs ſhoote at, &amp; to what we ſhuld direct the whole courſe of our life, that is to ſaie, he would haue vs honour him, and being once dedicated vnto his ſeruice, labour to conforme our ſelues fully and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto that righteouſnes which he hath ſet before vs. Howbeit we will handle this more at large, when as wee ſhall ſpeake of the law:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13060:71"/>but for this preſent it ſhal ſuffice that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that becauſe wee are carried with ſelfe loue, and that, that is not only as it were a wimple to blindfold our eyes, but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as it were wholly bewitch vs, ſo as wee are become very blockiſh, and do not once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue &amp; thinke of our miſeries. And therfore as I haue alreadie ſaid, it is meete that God ſhould condemne vs by his word.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.10 11.12.13 14.15.16.17.18.</note> And for that cauſe alſo doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> bring in ſo many teſtimonies, ſhewing by them that we are all damned. Euery one therfore, as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaid, ſhould haue this feeling in himſelfe without any other iudge: but becauſe we are ſo ſinfull, &amp; ſo full of diſsimulation, and haue ſo many ſhops and priuy cloſets, to withdraw &amp; put vs by from the true &amp; ſure knowledge of our ſinnes: therfore muſt the word of God ſerue vs for a looking glaſſe to behold them in. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing that we are of nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſe, &amp; nothing in vs but rebellion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and all our affections &amp; thoughts ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inimities againſt God as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> how can we any way poſsibly preſent &amp; offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maieſtie any thing that hee may well like of.

And therfore we muſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13060:71"/>confeſſe that as we are but naturall men, wee are ſo great enimies vnto god, as that our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts &amp; imaginations are all contrarie vnto his wil, neither can we ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as we liue, either ſpeak or do any thing whatſoeuer, but it muſt needs heap vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our heds a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore we ſee why the ſcripture compareth vs vnto dead men, when as God once forſaketh vs, &amp; vntill ſuch time as our Sauior Chriſt hath ſhewed himſelfe to be our life, we are no better then dead men. And I pray you what can a dead man doo? Moreouer, we are therefore to learne &amp; take forth this leſſon, or els we ſhal neuer be able to lay open what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnes of god is towards vs in our lord Ieſus Chriſt. But ſhuld diſpaire in our ſelues to put our truſt in God. For wee are ſo inclined vnto this preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is ſo rooted in vs, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we wil alwaies extoll our ſelues. And therfore god muſt altogither caſt vs down, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be redreſſed by his hand, &amp; vpholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his power.

And ſo namely why it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.15.</note> 
               <hi>That God filleth the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry &amp; pore afflicted.</hi> No doubt of it his goodnes exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it ſelf to none but to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are worthy of it: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeak of gathering his church togither, he muſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:13060:72"/>prepare it by this meane, and for that cauſe it is namely ſaid,<note place="margin">Eſay 91.<hi>1</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the ſpirite of God must rest vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that he might announce deliuerance vnto the captiues, to make the miſerable blind to ſee, to heale the ſick and diſeaſed, and to ſtrengthen &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the feeble and weake. Now hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth that when he ſaith, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour and are heauie laden, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you, and you ſhall finde reſt to your ſoules.</hi> Here then we ſee that it is humilitie that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that wee might be partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes which he bringeth vs. Now, humilitie is not ſuch a maner of thing as many ſuppoſe it to be, as to ſhewe a godly and humble countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but we muſt be ſo bare and emptie of any good thing in vs, as that we muſt caſt our ſelues downe at his feete, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that wee are nothing els but miſerable and wretched ſinners, and ſo without al hope of ſaluation as of our ſelues. Thus we ſee how wee come vnto his mercie, which is by the feeling &amp; apprehending of our miſeries. And theſe two things ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſeperated. For why is it that God taketh pitie vpon vs and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs? Forſooth, it is becauſe he beholdeth our miſeries, and that is it which ſtirreth and moueth him to mercie. And ſee alſo why S. <hi>Paul</hi> treating of our ſaluation ſaith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.8.10.</note> 
               <hi>you are not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13060:72"/>ſaued as of your ſelues, it is the gift of God throgh faith: for ye are his workemanſhip, becauſe hee hath created you in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good works, which he hath before ordeined that ye ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oo them.</hi> Here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth whatſoeuer good opinion wee can conceiue of our owne power, when as he ſaith, Go to now, if ye ſhal attribute any part of commendation of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnto your ſelues, and yet thinke that you haue not atteined thereunto as of your ſelues, but that you haue been holpen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: ſee how this geare may or can ſtand togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For you were created mortal men, that is to ſay, Sinners: and therefore all accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, baniſhed and eſtraunged from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, in whom is all goodneſſe. And therefore you muſt conclude, that you are all as it were dead. Wherefore there muſt be a new and a ſecond amendment and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before you bee any thing in the ſight of God. And when you haue been regenerated in Ieſus Chriſt, the ſame then is called, a new creation. And therefore euerie one of you is the creature of God, when as he hath formed and called you vnto himſelfe, without anie diſpoſition therunto for your owne part, but God hath prepared good workes by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpirit. Seeing then that it is thus, we may very well conclude, that our ſaluation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no whit of our ſelues, no not one drop
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13060:73"/>of it, but is the onely meere gift of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding of his owne liberality. Thus then we ſee as touching the firſt point, that for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of mercy and grace at God his hands, wee muſt truly acknowledge our ſelues what we are, how miſerable our eſtate &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, &amp; that we are all but caſtawaies. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſpeak thus, it is not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that our knowledge muſt be a rouing vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſwimming in our brain, but our harts muſt by it be deadly wounded, that we may feele the iudgements of God ſo to terrifie vs, as that wee may bee brought almoſt into vtter diſpaire. For, how ſhuld we know what a benefit meat &amp; drink is, except we were touched with hunger and thirſt? For if we were ſtuffed, &amp; ful, we would continue ſo, we would neuer ſeek after crum nor cruſt (as we ſay) but it is hunger that dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to hunt after victuals: for when wee are ſicke, wee ſeeke for remedie, but if a man wer ſo ſenſles as that he felt no kind of grief, he would die an hundreth times before hee wold call for help, or yet once deſire it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I haue alreadie ſaid) wee muſt bee ſo touched with our miſeries, as if we wer dead in deed, &amp; as if wee felt that death, whereof the ſcripture ſpeaketh, that wee might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that life whiche our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt offereth vnto vs by his Ghoſpell, and this is the cauſe why the ſcripture ſo often
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13060:73"/>reproueth, and as it were condemneth vs for our ſinnes. For God taketh no pleaſure in dealing with vs after this maner, but becauſe he knoweth the neceſsitie thereof. So then looke how many threatenings, ſentences of condemnation, of reproofes, and ſuch like are in the holy ſcripture, they are euen ſo many Mallettes to knocke vs on the heads, to bring vs vnto that humilitie which wee are ſo farre from, vntill ſuch time as hee hath violently in ſuch ſorte mortified vs. And thus much for this ſtraine. Moreouer, we muſt come to a larger account and recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which hath bin already ſpoken, which is, that vntill ſuch time as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our miſeries in the word of God, wee ſhall be lulled in a dead ſleepe in our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie &amp; become very careles: and this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will cauſe to contemne the word of God, and ſo by little and little be quite and cleane excluded from it. Now God hath ſet before vs our condemation, namely in the lawe: and in verie deed all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full of them: and when it is ſaid, that it is profitable, amongſt other thinges, it layeth out the reproofes. And beſides, we knowe what the Ghoſpell teacheth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16. Mat. 3.2. &amp; 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> Thus wee ſee how God diſpoſeth his elect to receiue the free righteouſnes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13060:74"/>which he beſtoweth vpon them by his ſonne, which is, that wee ſhould repent and amend. And what is the meaning hereof? Forſooth, there muſt be ſuch a ſorrow and griefe in vs for our ſinnes, as that we muſt condemne our ſelues for our wickednes, and be reuenged of our ſelues as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, that wee ſhould haue ſuch a vehement deſire and zeale, as to be as it were a duenged of our ſelues, becauſe wee are ſo great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto God: Now although this doctrine is met withall in all the holie ſcripture: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, God hath eſpecially or deined his law for that purpoſe, and therefore it is, why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">rom. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That it bringeth nothing but wrath.</hi> When as wee ſhall thronghly weigh and conſider that which is ſpoken, wee ſhall finde God to be againſt vs, and cannot come neare, without it be to haue him armed and thundring againſt vs, &amp; clearly to deſtroy vs. True at is, that the law right well ſheweth vs what it is to liue righteouſly, and to attaine thereunto if we were capable therof, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhal be more largely handled. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Leuiticus, <hi>That who ſoeuer ſhall do theſe thinges ſhall liue by them:</hi> but in the meane while, let vs ſee whether we come anie thing neare vnto that which God commandeth vs yea or no? In very deed, we are ſo arrogant
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13060:74"/>and proud, as that the law, vntill we well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, can neuer bee able to conuince and conquere all our fond preſumption. For we ſee how Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.10.</note> who from his youth was trained vp and inſtructed in the law, and a Doctor thereof; yet notwithſtanding ſaith that hee ſtill preſumed on his vertues, and thought himſelf to be a very righteous man, becauſe he knew the law, and reſted theron, and vtterly contemned the grace of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. And what was the reaſon? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe he looked no further but vnto the dead letter and outward ſhew thereof, as when it is ſaide, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> in verie deed he right well knew that he was no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer: Afterward it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultrie,</hi> neuer any man knew him to be a leacher or whoremaiſter. Next after: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> neither yet was it euer knowne that he was a theefe. And therefore he thought himſelf to be cleare before God. Thus wee ſee how in what a ſound drowſie ſleepe he was in his vaine flatteries. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward God awakened him and drew him further on, and made him enter and ſearch into the depth of his thoughts. And where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet,</hi> then he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo conuicted and condemned, as that there was no more abſolution for him. For he felt a great many of vanities in himſelfe that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13060:75"/>tickled him, his weakenes made him thinke vpon many temptations, and hee knew that he was not able to diſcharge himſelfe of the hundreth part of the loue of GOD which ought to be in al the faithful. This did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> know: and ſo we ſee how that he, like a miſerable dead man forgot his life, whereof he was beguiled &amp; deceiued, &amp; acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to be altogither like a wretched rotten carkes before God. For the law ſo ſlue him: as that hee had nothing in the world to preſume vpon in himſelfe. And therfore, as I haue alreadie ſaid, wee may ſee, that there is an eſpeciall reaſon conteined in the lawe of God, to ſhewe vs that there is nothing in vs but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation. For we muſt chiefly ſtand here vpon euery commandement. <hi>Wee must haue but one only God.</hi> And what is he? &amp; how muſt wee honour and ſerue him? Seeing then that we muſt be wholy bound and tied vnto him, let vs looke after none other good, feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, nor reioycing, but to glorifie him, let there be neuer heard from our mouthes anie thing els but praiſes &amp; thankſgiuing, vnto his maieſty, &amp; let it not be perceiued any maner of way, but that we forſake the world, and wholy deſire to come vnto him, &amp; to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his name as he worthily deſerueth. Thus then wee ſee the foure Commandements of the firſt table, ſet here before vs. Now when
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13060:75"/>we ſhal haue throughly ſerched the contents of them, let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to the examining of our ſelues, and we ſhall finde that in ſteed of reſting vpon him, we are become verie wilde roges &amp; vacabonds, and ſuch alſo as that our thoughts &amp; imaginations do lead vs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vs away euery where. And firſt let vs come to ſpeake of praier: for this action ſhould cauſe vs that are here beneath on the earth, to haue our cogitations in heauen, becauſe we are then as it were in the preſence of our God. And yet notwithſtanding when wee do praie, what a number of friuolous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſhall wee haue in our heades, which will holde vs their captiues? And ſeeing it is ſo, what muſt be the reſt of our whole life? Euen the lyke will become of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the lawe, when as we ſhall compare them with our liues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhall not finde one onely death, but an hundreth thouſand. Furthermore, wee ſee alſo how God in his lawe meaneth to touch vs to the quicke: for it is ſayd, that the heart muſt in deede and in good earneſt bee wounded. For, after that this ſentence is pronounced:<note place="margin">Deu. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Curſed bee hee that ſhall not doo all thinges which heere are written,</hi> hee is not contented alone to bee Iudge, and to haue thus condemned vs by his owne mouth: but will haue the people
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13060:76"/>alſo to ſay, <hi>Amen:</hi> that is to ſay, he wil haue euery man to condemne himſelfe willingly and of his owne accord, and ſo be altogither held as condemned, confeſsing the ſentence which he hath giuen to be iuſt and right. So then we ſee how the law driueth vs ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to examine &amp; trie our life, that we ſhal finde no hope in our ſelues, but bee driuen to ſeeke the beginning of our righteouſnes at our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his hand. Now we ſee, that theſe two things are as contrary one to another as fire and water, as, to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous before God by our works, and to be accepted of him, by the vertue and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of faith. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if wee ſhould bring any thing that is ours, no doubt of it God ſhould then be beholden vnto vs, although wee were neither wholly, nor yet perfectly righteous: yet how euer it were, there might ſome proportionable reward be done vnto vs. But it is ſaide, that faith and workes can neuer agree togither: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt be our concluſion, that when we are iuſtified by faith, workes muſt needes ceaſe and be nothing worth. Now this at the firſt ſight, may ſeeme to be an hard kinde of ſpeech, to wit, that faith and good works can neuer go togither: for it might ſeeme, that if faith onely iuſtifieth, that the raines are ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and let loſe to all iniquitie.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.12.</note> Now S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:13060:76"/>ſpeaketh this according to a certaine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and regard, as he alſo ſpeaketh of the law and faith the law, ſaith he, can no way agree with faith, for they are two incompatible things. And in what ſort? For is not God as well the Authour of the law as of the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? Is there any contrarietie or repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in him? without doubt no, for hee is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Why then findeth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuch a contrarietie betweene the law and the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? Forſooth it is in reſpect of our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And euen ſo is it between faith &amp; works: and the contrarietie is this, becauſe workes are made merits. And that which is more, we can doo no good worke but by faith, as wee haue already ſaid, and hereafter ſhalbe more largely handled For the cauſe and the effect are not contraries: but when we wil eſtabliſh any merit in our works, that is to ſay, when as we wil go about to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> auailable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fauor at Gods hand, &amp; to ſatisfie for our ſinnes: to be ſhort, when as we would bring them in, to ſerue vs for our ſaluation, this is, vtterly to ouerthrow faith, &amp; by this means, make it of no worth. Thus then we ſee, that it is not without cauſe why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thus: That ſeeing we are iuſtified by faith, then are workes of no value, but muſt be quite and cleane ſhut out of the doores, for any opinion that wee ought to attribute
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13060:77"/>vnto merites or vertues, whereby to pleaſe God withall. Now we are here eftſoones to note, that God of his meere liberalitie iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth vs, and ſearcheth after our miſeries to ſuſtain them, that he might be knowne to be only righteous, &amp; the commendation of our ſaluation, to bee abſolutely giuen vnto him accordingly, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> right well noteth both in his Epiſtle vnto the Epheſians, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto the Romanes,<note place="margin">Epheſ 1. Rom. 3.</note> ſaying: <hi>That God hath concluded all vnder ſin, that he might be knowne to be onely righteous, and euerie mouth bee ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> becauſe it is hee onelie that iuſlifieth ſinners through the grace of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that bringeth vs into the way of his righteouſnes. As alſo in the third to the Galathians, when as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this queſtion. How is it poſsible that God gaue the lawe after the promiſe? For it ſhould ſeeme that God chaunged his purpoſe, and was miſaduiſed, becauſe hee freely iuſtified <hi>Abram,</hi> and a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaue the law: and therein hee ſaith, <hi>That whoſoeuer ſhal do theſe things, ſhall liue by them.</hi> Hereunto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth, <hi>That the law was not giuen to adnihilate the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> but for the vſe, whereof I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſpoken, that is, that wee muſt bee all concluded vnder ſinne and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for elſe wee ſhould neuer feele of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13060:77"/>what price the mercie of God was, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looke after it, and beſides wee would thinke that wee had no neede of it. And in verie deed there are two ſortes of people, which make no account of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, robbing themſelues of all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which we haue by him, and of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation alſo which we haue by his death and reſurrection. The one ſort are they which perſuade themſelues to haue ſome worthines in them, and therupon in the aboundance of their pride deſpite God: and ſuch are your iolly rable of Monkes, Friers, and their like: who haue a certaine glorious glittering ſhew of righteouſnes, counterfetting a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and as it were, Angellike holines. Theſe men, I ſay, ſhut vp the Gate and haue no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance vuto Ieſus Chriſt: for the thruſt him farre inough of from themſelues. The ſecond ſort are they which are negligent and ſecure, &amp; think not themſelues to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And why ſo? for ſome of them ar whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters, ſome are theeues, ſome drnnkards, ſome effeminate perſons, and ſome ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God, as that little children may iudge them to be ſo. Theſe men are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by pride and arrogancy, but are made ſo drunke by ſatan, as that they neuer thinke of euerlaſting life, but are become altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brutiſh. And ſee why <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13060:78"/>
               <hi>That he is happie and bleſsed who is carefull ouer his owne heart. And which feareth, and watcheth to vnderſtand his ſinnes and wretchednes.</hi> We ſee then that the law was not giuen after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for any other reaſon, but to condemne vs, to the end we might ſeek for all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in God, and to giue all praiſe vnto him for our ſaluation. Let vs then here note this finall cauſe, and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Chapter to the Epheſians, diſcourſeth of this matter more at large. For hee paſſeth it not ouer ſlightly, but handlet the matter ſo as if he would thunder it in our cares, to the end ſaith hee, <hi>That the glorie of God might bee knowne, hee alone to be glorified, hee alone to bee knowne righteous, that we might know that from him we haue all.</hi> For wee muſt know ſaith hee, <hi>That without his meere fauour and grace we are all camned.</hi> Here we ſee I ſay in ſumme what God his pretence is, when he taketh from vs all opinion of our owne power and ſtrength, that is, hee meaneth that he would haue him ſelfe to be knowne to be onely iuſt, and vs to be loſt and damned ſoules of our ſelues. So that whoſoeuer they are which chalenge to themſelues the leaſt righteouſnes that may be, as if they were aiders and aſsiſters vnto God, as the Papiſts call themſelues Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators or workers togither with God, doo without doubt, commit a more deteſtable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13060:78"/>fault then all the theeues in the world. For what is it to take away from a mortall man gold and ſiluer, and all that hee is worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in reſpect of robbing God of his honor being the chiefeſt thing that he deſireth, to haue to be reſerued vnto himſelfe? which is this, that hee alone is to bee acknowledged righteous: and then when miſerable mortall creatures, or rather crawling vermine on the earth, who are no better then a moſt corrupt and filthie thing, ſhal ſtand vp in Gods ſteed and ſay, Thou art not the whole worker of our ſaluation, but we haue holpen thee in it. Is not this moſt curſed blaſphemy, when as we ſhall preſume to bring with vs ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſnes before God? But here we are to remember that which we yeſterday handled, that is to ſay, that this word Iuſtifie, importeth not that wee are made righteous, that is, that God ſo renueth vs, as that we are Angels: but it importeth that hee accepteth and alloweth of vs of his meere goodnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we be miſerable ſinners. And therefore wee may heere ſee, how <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place toucheth this word Impute, as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, that this hangeth vpon the free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, and is not be enquired of whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſnes is in regard of man, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is worthie to be accepted. There is none at all of this meant. But let vs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13060:79"/>that God accepteth vs for righteous, al thogh we are no whit ſo in deed. And here alſo wee ſee why the righteouſnes of faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth works: for looke what is wanting in vs we receiue from Ieſus Chriſt. I ſay not in part, as the Papiſts enſnare themſelues, but we borrow the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt: becauſe there is not a droppe or yet a myte therof in vs. And therfore works muſt needs be ouerthrowne, when as we ſeek for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes els where. For if there were onely one part in Ieſus Chriſt, and another in vs, hee ſhould not be the whole: &amp; then how ſhould this ſaying be fulfilled,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> 
               <hi>That the fulnes of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were giuen to him by the holie Ghoſt, that hee might diſtribute them vnto euerie one according to meaſure?</hi> For theſe two words, <hi>To get,</hi> and to <hi>Receiue,</hi> are cleane contrarie one to the other: and when God iuſtifieth vs, it is by his adoption, and becauſe wee are by nature the children of wrath, therefore he adopteth vs and taketh vs for his children. And what findeth hee in vs? nothing in the world that can induce vs, to do well. And therefore the inheritance of our ſaluation which wee hope after, and which is promiſed vs in the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, commeth from this adoption of God, and from nothing that is in vs: for if wee could obtaine or get anie thing of our ſelues, without doubt wee would part ſtakes with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13060:79"/>God, euen as the Papiſtes doo. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD ſo dealeth as that wee doo nothing, therefore is hee alone to bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. We now preſently ſee in ſumme, that the righteouſnes which is here ſpoken of, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth nothing elſe but the remiſsion of ſinnes, and the credite which we haue in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to bee made righteous through the merite of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would ſeuerely inſtruct vs, according to our childiſhnes, hee bringeth in onely remiſsion of ſinnes, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth after this ſort, We cannot, ſaith hee, be iuſtified by our workes: and why ſo? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe it is written:<note place="margin">Pſa. 32.1.</note> 
               <hi>The man is bleſsed whoſe ſinne. the Lord pardoneth, and whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are remitted, and whoſe wickednes is not imputed vnto him.</hi> Heere ſaith hee, wee ſee all our felicitie, which is, when God recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to mercie, and forgetteth &amp; burieth all our ſinnes, whereof wee are guiltie before him. Seeing then it is ſo, it muſt needs follow, that wee are all accurſed vntill ſuch time as God hath forgiuen vs: and if wee be wicked, where then ſhall be found our righteouſnes? For, god cannot hate that which is agreeable vnto his nature, for hee is the fountaine or all righteouſnes: And therefore if he finde in vs neuer ſo little goodneſſe, no doubt of it hee will accept of it. Wherefore wee
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13060:80"/>muſt conclude, that becauſe we are wicked, we are vnrighteous and altogither accurſed, and can no way be bleſſed without God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs. Now, if he loueth vs, he muſt needs eftſoones allow and like of vs, and if hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and like of vs, we muſt needs be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Theſe are principles which we ought to vnderſtand. Howbeit wee are yet to know, that we cannot be bleſſed without God loue vs: for ſo long as he is our enemie, Alas, in what a wofull eſtate and condition are wee? Whereuppon then dependeth our felicitie? Forſooth euen heerein, when as God loueth vs. We are now to conſider how it is that hee loueth vs: hee muſt needs allow and like of vs, as I haue alreadie ſaid, for he cannot deny himſelfe. For if hee reiect &amp; abhorre vs, how ſhall we be reconciled vnto him? Now let vs ſee by what means: for God cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, and if (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch thing it were in vaine: for hee will continue alwaies like himſelfe, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well inough to ſeperate vs with all our leaſings, and race vs out of his Rowle: and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>all God then allow &amp; like of vs? Wel ſir, we muſt be righteous. Now, what righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is it? It is not that righteousnes which we ſuppoſe to haue in our workes, ne that we are able to acquire our ſelues before him, or yet ſatiſfie by any duetie that wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13060:80"/>none of all this will ſerue our turnies. What righteouſnes then is it? Forſooth euen this, that God muſt pardon our ſinnes, forget our iniquities, and not impute our offences vnto vs. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> had reaſon to vſe theſe three maner of ſpeeches: for a man would thinke, this to be a ſuperfluous kinde of language: but he eſpecially reitterateth this, becauſe the condition of man wherein he is borne and drowned ouer head &amp; eares, is not onely a bottomles depth, vntill ſuch time as God draweth him out thereof, but the bottomles depth of all depthes, that is, it is the bottomles depth of hell. And therfore God muſt deale herein after a ſinguler ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And therefore we ſee why he alſo ſoone after ſpeaketh, and that in the ſpirit in whom is no deceit: for it is meet we ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how neceſſary the mercy of God is for vs, becauſe our ſinnes are ſo filthie and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as that they are able to infect and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon both heauen &amp; earth, and not to prouoke God alone againſt vs, but alſo the Angels, the Sunne and Moone &amp; all the hoſtes both of heauen and earth. Wherefore we ſee why <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo highly magnifieth the forgiuenes of ſinnes. And thereupon S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo concludeth, and ſheweth vs wherein our whole righteouſnes conſiſteth, which is, that onr ſinnes are forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. And let vs likewiſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13060:81"/>note as I haue alreadie ſaid, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth &amp; ſetteth it down in the ſpirit, in whom is no guile: for hee ſheweth that we cannot haue our ſinnes forgiuen vs, albeit God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs forgiuenes: vntill ſuch time as wee be wholly confounded in our ſelues, and bee ſo rowzed vp &amp; awakened, as that no hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie nor diſsimulation make vs belieue this or that, ne yet remaine in a dead ſleepe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: but that we finde our ſelues to be like moſt miſerable damned and loſt ſoules, and ſuch as the iudgements of God do ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, as that we know not which way to turn vs, and to be in ſuch a deſperate caſe as if we ſaw preſent death before vs, and the hand of God armed to execute the ſentence of the curſe which he pronounceth againſt vs. And this is the definition of the righteouſnes which wee are to note, if wee will haue it rightly defined. Wee ſee alſo why it is ſayd in the fifteenth of the Acts, where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ceremonies of the law ſaith, that we muſt be iuſtified by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, of all the thinges whereof the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not iuſtefie vs. This word the Law, carrieth here a long taile with it: for, wee muſt vnderſtand why S. <hi>Paul,</hi> eſpecially ſpeaketh of the ceremonies of the law, when as heſaith, that works cannot any waies make vs acceptable before God. Now the Papiſts,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13060:81"/>and manie of the auncient Fathers which knew not the ſcriptures, but were as a man would ſay halfe Philoſophers, were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully troubled about this word the Law, and though that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> contended not about morall workes as they called them: that is to ſay, that hee went not about to deny that we were not righteous before GOD, if we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued chaſtly, temperately, ſoberly, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging no man, and holding all ſuch other lyke morall vertues: they thought that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> touched none of this, but meant in verie deed that all theſe workes, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerued ſaluation: but they thought that the ceremonies of the lawe could no way bee profitable to iuſtification. Now this imagination is too too groſſe follie: for, firſt, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> neuer once ſpake of the ceremonies of the law.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſee here I beſeech you, how moſt vnaduiſedly they are abuſed: and to prooue it to bee ſo, conſider that place of the Pſalme which I erſt alledged, how <hi>Dauid</hi> placeth mans bleſſedneſſe in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.1.</note> without naming anye worke: and this ſpeakyng of workes comprehendeth within it all vertnes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, whiche wee can anye waye attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto our ſelues, and wherein wee greatlie glorie. Now this curſednes (Saint
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13060:82"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) ſheweth that we muſt needs come all naked and emptie before God, that wee might be filled &amp; enriched of his meere and free goodnes. Moreouer, when as hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the workes of the lawe, it is becauſe that if there be any merite in them, it is by reaſon of the couenant which we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alledged,<note place="margin">Leui. 18.5</note> 
               <hi>That whoſoeuer ſhall doo theſe things, ſhal liue in them.</hi> Put the caſe that there neuer had bin any law publiſhed, yet ſhould we haue been no whit the more acceptable vnto God. And as for himſelfe he oweth vs no duetie, neither is he any whit bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs:<note place="margin">Lu. 17.11</note> for it is ſaid, <hi>That when wee haue done whatſoeuer is commanded vs, yet muſt we needes confeſse that we are vnprofitable ſeruants.</hi> And why ſo? what? are we at our owne choiſe and libertie to doo what wee luſt? Is there anie thing in vs that is our owne? no verely, and therefore cannot we plead any merit, albeit we perfectly fulfilled the law. Whereuppon then dependeth the confidence which wee take in our workes? Forſooth euen vpon this promiſe, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall do theſe thinges, ſhall liue by them.</hi> For God bounde himſelfe hereunto of his owne accord, albeit hee was not in reaſon tied vnto it. Wherefore when as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the workes of the law, he ſheweth, that although God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all thoſe to whom he hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13060:82"/>that how many ſoeuer ſhall accompliſh all which hee hath commanded by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the law, ſhall be reputed &amp; taken to be righteous, and haue thereby euerlaſting life: notwithſtanding that the workes of the law cannot do it. And why ſo? becauſe they ſtill leaue vs vnder the curſe of the law and condemnation: for wee can do nothing elſe but ſinne, ſo long as we remain in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the fleſh, and hee whatſoeuer hee is, that ſhall thinke himſelfe to be moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſhall neuer be able to acquite and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelfe of the hundreth part of his duetie therein. What ſhall we then doo, but euen hold downe our heades, and proſtrate our ſelues at the feete of our Iudge, and ſo craue pardon and forgiuenes? as heereafter ſhall be more largely let downe. Let vs now then returne vnto the place depending vpon that which I haue alreadie touched, which is, that Ieſus Chriſt is ſet before vs to iuſtitie vs in all things whereof the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was neuer able to do. For it ſhuld ſeem, that they thought themſelues to be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wel by the ceremonies, as alſo by all the reſt of the law, to make them of great account before God, and to be able to pleaſe him: for if they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then had they the ſacrifices as fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the ſprinkeling of blood to cleanſe them, certaine waſhings alſo to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13060:83"/>vnto God, and many other promiſes beſides. It ſhould ſeeme then that all this was nothing to make them acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but contrariwiſe, that Ieſus Chriſt muſt come to iuſtifie vs of thoſe thinges, whereof the law was neuer able to do. What is ment by this ſaying to iuſtifie vs of things? That is to ſaie, to pardon and forgiue vs them. Wee ſee now by this place which I haue alreadie ſpoken of, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaketh of, is not a thing reſident in our perſons. But Gods free forgiuing of vs, when as hee is mercifull and louing vnto vs, albeit we are no whit worthy thereof: for this which <hi>Moſes</hi> heere ſetteth downe, ſhal neuer be able to be found in any man whatſoeuer, but in Ieſus Chriſt who muſt onely iuſtifie vs: and how is that? that is, if the Diuell ſhall accuſe vs, and God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to iudge and condemne vs: then will Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt anſwere for vs as our ſuretie. Thus we ſee how the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs as a cloake to couer al our rebellions and iniquities. It is he that hath ſatisfied for vs, and diſcharged vs of all our debtes by the merit of his death, &amp; ſhed his precious bloud to waſh vs withall. To be ſhort, we finde in the perſon of the Sonne of God, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is requiſite to make vs acceptable before him, becauſe our ſinnes are not imputed vnto
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13060:83"/>vs. Here then we ſee in ſumme, what we are to remember from this place. We are now to proceed ſomewhat further, that is to ſay, that when God hath once for all receiued vs thus to mercy, how hee continueth, holdeth, and voweth vs for righteous all the daies of our liues, and euen in death alſo: for this is the principal point wherat we muſt aime &amp; come vnto, howbeit we cannot at this time ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to handle it. Let it ſuffice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end things might be well kept in minde, that wee know &amp; vnderſtand what the open way is, that wee muſt haue to be partakers of the euerlaſting ſaluation which commeth vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, that is, wee muſt know &amp; vnderſtand how miſerable &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched our ſtate and condition is, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing the ſame with our mouthes onely, or hauing a vain imagination ſwimming in our brains therof. But to be ſo ſorrowfully woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and greeued, as that wee be confounded before the maieſtie of God, euen to the very hating &amp; deteſting of our owne ſelues. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall thus rightly iudge of our ſelues, then ſhall wee be ſure that God will forgiue vs. And when wee ſhall bee thus mortified in our ſelues, then ſhall wee finde life in Ieſus Chriſt. For it is not inough that we knowe our ſelues to bee verie wretched ſicke creatures, and poore and needie ſoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:13060:84"/>but we muſt be dead altogither, to the end we might by the onely grace of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be reuiued. And that hereupon we may bee ſo humbled as the ſcripture willeth vs, which is, to giue vnto god that honor that is due vnto him. And it is not without cauſe that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.17.</note> when as he ſaith, <hi>That it is an humble and contrite heart which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</hi> For wee ſhall neuer come vnto him except wee bee altogither caſt downe in our ſelues. And then wee muſt carry this minde and affection with vs, that we are wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieued &amp; perplexed in our diſtreſſes, and then will we in deed confeſſe that we are not righteous. And then alſo ſhall our deſire and affection be ſo enflamed, as that we ſhall not looke for our righteouſnes in our merits, but cleane contrary, and hauing caſt away all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, looke for all our benefit and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his onely Sonne, and ſo when wee haue once knowne that hee hath pluckt vs out of the ſhadow of death, our mouthes ſhall then be open and diſpoſed to preach his vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able praiſes, according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> treating of the end of our ſaluation, in the firſt Chapiter of his firſt Canonicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
            <p>Let vs now proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſinnes, beſeeching him to cauſe

               <hi>That hee is called the ſeale of the inheritance of ſaluation which we wait and looke for.</hi> Seeing then it is ſo, that the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith importeth that we are gods adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted children, and that our ſaluation is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there muſt alſo be put to a ſeal, as a ſigne and token that it is infallible. Here then wee ſee, that it is not inough for vs to confeſſe that God is the author of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the ſame to be attributed to him only: but we muſt alſo on the other ſides come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; priuatly cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as our father,

Now to ſay thus, is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ouerthrow the whole foundation of Chriſtianitie. And in very deed, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this matter, hee driueth vs vnto this reaſon,<note place="margin">Ro. 4.14.</note> which is, that if we depend vpon the law and truſt vnto it, then is Faith but vaine, and the promiſe made of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And why ſo? Forſooth, it is not becauſe God is not faithfull for his part, but becauſe we ſhal neuer be able to attaine vnto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that which is required for our ſaluation. For God doth ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now this is an impoſsible condition. For neuer man yet hath accompliſhed the lawe, nor neuer ſhall. So then we for our parts are neuer able to effect &amp; performe this promiſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall alwaies be reaſoning, wauering, and out of quiet, and in the end fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, when as we ſhall go about to bring our

               <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant O Lord: for no man liuing ſhall be iustified in thy ſight.</hi> And therfore we muſt conclude, that we ſhalbe euer vexed and troubled, and our ſpirits wonderfully perplexed, if we had not ſaluation elfe where then from our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And for the better vnderſtanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let vs wel weigh &amp; conſider of that which hath been alreadie ſpoken, that is, wee muſt not thinke to paie God with nifles. For it is a fearefull thing to haue him againſt vs. Now he cannot otherwiſe be, but ſo long as wee ſhall preſume vpon workes. For we do euen ſo much derogate from him, and robbe him of his right, as hath been heretofore ſhewed, that whoſoeuer hath not his mouth ſtopped from attributing vnto himſelfe the leaſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and his mouth wide to confeſſe God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be iuſt: without doubt that man oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf vnto his maieſtie.

               <hi>That hee which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad to commit adulterie, forbad alſo to ſteale.</hi> For although a man ſhall haue liued all the dayes of his life chaſtly, and yet bee guiltie of ſome other precept, hee is neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe but a damned ſoule.<note place="margin">Mat. 19.6</note> And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe that that which God hath coupled togither, we muſt not ſeperate. The righteouſnes of the lawe is coupled and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted togither: and therefore we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cut it in pieces &amp; gobets, nor deuide it. Let vs now then conſider, whether we be able in part or in whole ſo to acquite our ſelues, as that the whole courſe of our life may not bee amended. Alas what are wee then? And as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, who can ſaie I haue cleanſed mine hart?<note place="margin">Pro. 20.9.</note> In very deed, there are a great many that thinke they haue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are a great many of hypocrites in the world. And therefore that man as I haue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13060:87"/>alreadie ſaid, that is at that point, muſt needs be more then ſenſles: for if he conſider with what a iudge he hath to deale withall, how euer it fall out, when as wee ſhall haue well bethoght vs of all the matter, without doubt if wee bring with vs vnto him one ounce or perhappes an halfe ounce, there will be as a man would ſay, fiue times as much founde to weigh it downe: and when wee ſhall thinke to paie him with halfe an ounce, he wil finde matter inough to condemne vs in fiue times as much. And what ſhall become of vs then? Let vs therefore learne rightly to know what wée are, that wee be not in the ende found worſe then naught. And let vs conſider as I haue alreadie ſayd, that wee can neuer be ſaued, except we be aſſured that we may call vpon God as vpon our Father. Now beſides this firſt abuſe, there is a ſecond, which is, that they that thinke to be iuſtified by their merites, doo neuer conſider that not one of our workes is good, when as God will looke ſtraitly vnto them: for as I haue already ſaid, although we ſhould keep the one halfe of the lawe or three partes of it, yet were it all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for we ſhould all be condemned if we failed but in one only point: and yet there is another reaſon, to wit, we neuer once came neare the accompliſhyng of the lawe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or yet in part. And how ſo?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13060:88"/>we ſaide yeſterday that God iudgeth not of our workes as we imagine. For hee hath his owne weightes and balance. And how iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth he them? Forſooth, he looketh whether the heart be pure and cleane from all fleſhly pollutions. And where ſhall a man finde ſuch an heart? We are euer maſhed in a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of wicked affections, and although they reigne not in vs, yet can we not be altogither rid of them. Moreouer, we ſhall neuer finde ſuch a zeale in vs to glorify God as we ſhuld, but that there will be alwaies ſome infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: we may haue a good meaning to do well, but yet it ſhall not bee ſo perfectly done, as that it may ſtand before his face. Now we do not here ſpeake of this as to ſay, I thinke, and I ſuppoſe: but wee muſt conclude and ſaie, God hath ſaid ſo, and God alloweth and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it. And therefore we ſhould be very far of, from deſeruing any thing before him, nor yet be quiet in conſcience: for, ouer and beſides that we faile in many things, and that there is no man but hath alwayes ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience, &amp; although we thought to do the beſt that wee poſsibly might, yet were it altogither halting and lame. Yea and there may bee alſo ſome infirmitie that may pollute euen very good workes in deed. For was there euer a better woorke then that of <hi>Abram,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ge. 22.10.</note> when hee was readie to kill his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13060:88"/>owne ſonne? And yet notwithſtanding, his heart was touched with many ſorrowes and griefes, which ſhewed his weaknes. Thus then we ſee, that this worke was poluted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, &amp; could not be reputed to be anie merit. What ſhall we ſay then to that which we do, conſidering that none of vs all but is ſoone ſtaied, when as we ſhall once be ſpoken vnto to go that way. And although we would gladly employ our ſelues to ſerue God faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, yet goe we not ſo rightly and ſoundly on as we ſhould, by the hundreth part. And muſt we needes be continually vexed &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet? yea verily, &amp; we all know it, without we wil be too too blind. Now as I haue alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaid, we muſt aſſure our ſelues that God loueth vs, receiueth and accepteth of vs, as if we were righteous. And from whome haue we this priuiledge? Wee muſt come to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romanes:<note place="margin">Rom 10.</note> which is, we muſt looke vpon our lord Ieſus Chriſt. For, when our ſaluation is ſpoken of, &amp; then behold the glorious heauen, we are by and by on the one ſide, aſtoniſhed and amazed thereat: becauſe we are not worthie once to come neare it. And beſides, wee ſee on the other ſides, hell ſtanding wide open before vs to ſwallow vs vp, becauſe wee are horrible wretched ſinners. And then will we ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heauen?</hi> For it is impoſsible
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13060:89"/>that wee ſhould come there: for where are our wings to flie vp thither? And beſides, as I haue already ſaid, hell ſtandeth gaping wide open readie to receiue vs: if ſo be that he wil giue iudgement againſt vs: and then we will ſaie, how know we that we are pardoned and forgiuen, but that God may verie well throw vs downe headlong into the bottomles pit of hell. Now hereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and ſetteth downe the remedie, which is this, that we muſt not doubt, but that heauen is ours. And how ſhal we be ſure of that? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe that in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt we know it to be ſet wide open for vs. And therefore the asking of this queſtion doubtfully, <hi>Who ſhall aſcende into Heauen?</hi> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is to fetch Ieſus Chriſt downe from thence.</hi> For wee knowe that the Sonne of God hath ſaide, <hi>That there are manie Manſions in his fathers houſe,</hi> and that hee hath not taken them for his owne perticuler benefite, but to the ende to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs togither vnto himſelfe, as fellowe heires with him. As concerning hell, he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into it: for hee ſuffred the torments and paines which wee ſhould haue ſuffered, hee ſuffered the horrible torments of Gods wrathfull curſe, which made him cry out and ſaie, <hi>My God, mys God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Euen ſo then when as we make our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13060:89"/>certaine, then we may ſee that we are aſſured. And that alſo is his meaning where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ro. 8.33.</note> 
               <hi>Who ſhall laie anie thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> He is angry with Sathan and with whatſoeuer is againſt vs, as if he would haue ſaid, ſeeing that wee haue forſaken all our arrogancy, and haue no ſuch imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as once to thinke that we can bring anie thing of our own with vs vnto God to make vs acceptable, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that we know that it is of his owne free mercy and goodnes that he hath choſen vs, as alſo called vs vnto him ſelfe by the Goſpel, let the diuel with all his ſuppoſtes accuſe vs as much as they luſt, yet will he iuſtifie &amp; pardon vs: &amp; how? Forſooth ſaith hee, behold how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt maketh interſeſsion for vs, &amp; by the power and vertue of this praier, forſomuch as hee is our Advocate for the appaiſing of the wrath of God his Father, by this we ſee how we are pardoned. And this is the certaintie wherof he ſpeaketh in another place, as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> This alſo is ſhewed vnto vs in the perſon of the poore publican, that is to ſay, of the cuſtomer whom the people ſcorned whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came vnto God to pray.<note place="margin">Lu. 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:13060:90"/>But when hee looked towardes him, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, and was aſhamed, crauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pardon: and Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, that he was iuſtified euen with that onely ſpeech. And wee ſee that the Phariſie was reiected, becauſe hee ſo fooliſhly preſumed of his workes. And the Publican who plainly and ſimply confeſſed himſelfe to be a miſerable ſinner, and ſo wretched and damned a ſoule departed iuſtified before God: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Phariſie commended not himſelfe by reaſon of his merits, for he ſayd not, I haue done this, and I haue done that, and therefore God is beholden vnto me for them: but ſaid onely thus, <hi>God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are, an extortioner, vniuſt, a theefe, nor an Adulterer, nor as this Publican.</hi> A man would thinke this to bee a iolly entrance, when as hee ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly vnto God, and proteſted that whatſoeuer goodnes and vertue was in him, proceeded from the meere gift of the holie Ghoſt: but what of all this? yet was hee ſo proudly and arrogantly puffed vp, as that he thought himſelfe to be allowed and liked of for his works. And therfore we ſee why God condemned him: for it could not be choſen but that he was exceeding blockiſh, to think that God was bound vnto him for his works. Wherefore wee muſt all flie vnto the meere
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13060:90"/>mercy of God, and then, I ſaie, we ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he will loue vs, when as wee ſhall looke for all our merits in Ieſus Chriſt, neuer ceaſing to praie vnto him notwithſtanding our great vnworthines, becauſe he hath not adopted vs, either for our perſons or yet for our workes, but of his meere and free mercy: thus wee ſee how wee ſhall be aſſured of our ſaluation. True it is, that we ſhall alwaies be full of ſcruples and doubtes, by reaſon that our faith is not perfect in vs: but yet our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ſhall alwaies ſurmount, ſo long as we fight ſtoutly, and embrace the promiſes of God, and make them a buckler and defence againſt all the temptations and diſtruſtes, which the diuell ſhall ſet before vs. When then we ſpeake of this certaintie of faith, we meane not but that it may be ſhaken, and we, many times be greatly perplexed &amp; diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but our meaning is, that we may in the end conclude how euer it fall out, that God wil haue mercy vpon vs, and ſo vpon this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurednes pray vnto him. And this is it which we are now to keepe in minde. We eaſily ſee then by this, that they which haue taken this word <hi>Iuſtifie,</hi> to be ſaid that God chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs, and gouerneth vs by his holie ſpirit to ſerue God, are too too much abuſed: for there are many that will ſay that wee are not iuſtified by our merits, neither yet that there
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13060:91"/>is anie one iote in vs wherein to glorie, and that whatſoeuer goodnes is in vs commeth from the free gift of God, becauſe that as of our ſelues we can doo nothing els but ſin: all this they will confeſſe, and wil in ſumme ſay, that we are iuſtified by meere grace and not by our workes, and that there is no goodnes in vs, but that God giueth all: haue they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all this? Yea verily: and yet they ſtill go about to ouerthrow both themſelues and others. And how ſo? Forſooth, becauſe they thinke that they haue atteined vnto perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as in verie deed, there is nothing els in them but imperfection. For, where ſhal we find a man that when he ſhall be thus caſt down in himſelf, as to be no bodie as it were, and confeſſe himſelf to be altogither accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; whatſoeuer goodnes is in him to come of Gods owne meere liberalitie, ſo as God is therfore to be exalted &amp; magnified, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be nothing, to the ende hee might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge &amp; humble himſelfe vnto God &amp; ſay, that all which he hath, he receiueth from his meere goodnes? Yea but we haue already ſaid that if we be doubting, then are heauen gates ſhut vp againſt vs. Now we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chuſe but doubt, or els be ſtarke ſtaring mad when as we regard our own works. Admit that god by his holie ſpirit hath regenerated a man, &amp; doth onely thanke God as the Phariſie did,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13060:91"/>and ſay, ſurely all that I haue I haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and yet notwithſtanding when he praieth, he muſt pray confidently and in full aſſurance. And how ſhall he do that? For whileſt he is yet imperfect and weake, the vertues which God hath beſtowed vpon him ſhall be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with many vices: yea &amp; theſe vertues alſo ſhalbe corrupt, becauſe I ſay, he ſhal not be fully clenſed of the ſpots of the fleſh. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man ſhal find himſelfe thus as a man would ſay, half ſeas ouer, &amp; yet be far from the end and marke whether he would go, how can he otherwiſe do but doubt? Let vs therfore now conclude, that it is nothing to confeſſe &amp; ſay that our ſaluation proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meere grace &amp; fauor of God, becauſe he gouerneth vs with his holy ſpirit, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remiſsion of our ſins. And ſo they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> plaie the wrangling ſo phiſters herein, ſaying, that we are not iuſtified by our works, becauſe the good workes are not ours, but the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, forget that point which wee erſt touched, that is to ſay, that our faith muſt be certain, &amp; that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be certain except Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be our aduocat, &amp; his death a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſins, ſo as we cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> debt, as by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue alleged may be ſeen. And we ſee alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this righteouſnes muſt not be for a day only, but muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13060:92"/>of our liues. For although we haue profited by ſeruing of God, yet for all that it hath bin in imperfection. And therefore it is plaine faith that muſt iuſtifie vs. And here muſt be put to the wall and ouerthrowne, that fooliſh and peruerſe opinion of the Papiſtes, who thinke themſelues to bee partly iuſtified by their woorkes, and partly by the forgiuenes which they obtaine by the grace of God: for God muſt fully and wholly be mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as hath been ſhewed. And why ſo? For part of our workes merite nothing: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is corruption euen in the verie beſt worke we do, if we ſhall ſpeake of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it according to the worthines therof. And therefore we ſee that we are fully and wholly excluded. Wherefore we muſt grow to this point, that the moſt righteous, althogh they ſeeme as righteous as tht Angels, yet muſt they be accepted of God freely. But here may ariſe an obiection in this ſort: why fir? there is a great difference betweene thoſe whom God hath alreadie called, and thoſe who are altogither eſtranged from him, and alſo there is great diuerſitie betweene the faithfull man, when as God hath ſet him in the right way, and when he leaueth him vnto the corruption of his owne nature. For wee ſhall ſee ſome man to haue liued a long time like a ſtraied ſheep &amp; caſtaway: and at laſt,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13060:92"/>God enlighteneth him by his Ghoſpell, and ſo toucheth and reformeth him, as that a man ſhall ſee him, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new creature. And without doubt, we can neuer be ſaid to be right Chriſtians, without we be after that maner renued, and be made the workemanſhip of God created in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: to doo the workes which God hath prepared: all this, I ſay, muſt be in it. But herein may ſeeme to be ſome abſurditie. God iuſtified the theefe that was hanged, becauſe he acknowledged his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in Ieſus Chriſt: and when hee was iuſtified, had hee none other qualitie in him then he had before? Yes verely. Why then ſay we, that free righteouſnes hath hir courſe all our life long. In deed a faithfull man will at the leaſt be well affected to hold himſelfe within the compaſſe of Gods obedience, he will be diſpleaſed with his ſinnes, yea groane and greeue for them, and his chiefe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re wil be to frame his life according to the lawe. Now when a faithful man is come to this, we muſt not ſay that hee is iuſtified as hee was at the firſt, bicauſe he was then a diſſolute man, and altogither eſtranged from God. To this we anſwere, when God at the firſt iuſtifieth vs, that is to ſaie, when hee hath mercy vpon vs, and plucketh vs out from that condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein we were, he vſeth then a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13060:93"/>pardon: and then when hee iuſtifieth vs afterward, he then acknowkledgeth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which hee hath beſtowed vpon vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoweth &amp; alloweth them, for he cannot deny himſelf: &amp; when he gouerneth vs by his holy ſpirit, although ſinne dwelleth in vs, yet reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it not in vs, as it is written, <hi>Although wee doo not the good which wee would,</hi> yet wee ſtriue to do it. And therefore God alloweth and liketh of that, becauſe it commeth from him: but here we are to note, that he iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs both in our perſons and alſo in our workes by faith only. For when he receiueth vs at the firſt, he cannot iuſtifie anie workes that are in vs. And why ſo? becauſe they are all wicked. For as wee haue alreadie ſaide, what fruit can a rotten tree bring forth. And therefore when God draweth vnto him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinners, that are baniſhed and caſt out of his kingdome and Church, he doth not iuſtifie their works: but beholding their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and hauing compaſsion of their perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lo, for that cauſe he iuſtifieth them. Now after that hee hath receiued them, he iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in their perſons, that is to ſay, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth them as his children, and after that, he iuſtifieth their workes: and how doth he that? Forſooth, not by calling them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nor iudging them rigorouſly: for there will be alwaies, as I haue ſaid, ſome corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:13060:93"/>amongſt, or els ſome ſlips and by ſlidings and ſuch like things which wil marre all. For if a man put the beſt wine in the worlde into an vnſauery hogſhead, or into a fuſtie bottle, the wine wil be all mard. Euen ſo fareth it with all our works: for ſo long as God guideth and gonerneth vs by his holy ſpirit, they ar good, holy, &amp; commendable: but marke what veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels we are, ſurely very filthy &amp; corrupt. Euen ſo are our works, &amp; therfore God muſt purge &amp; cleanſe them. And how is that? verily euen by his grace in pardoning the faults &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are in them. Wherfore euen as there is diuerſitie between a faithfull man, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God calleth at the beginning vnto the Goſpel, ſo alſo is there ſome diuerſity in iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it altereth not in this behalf, that is, that God alwaies iuſtifieth his freely, that is to ſay, that he accepteth them, not for anie vertues that are in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for there is none at all in them, neither yet for thoſe which he hath beſtowed vpon them: for they are to be condemned by reaſon of the infirmitie that is in them. But becauſe as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>That thoſe whome hee hath choſen he hath iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Here then we ſee in ſumme, what we are to retaine as touching the motion of this queſtion. Now we are to note, that ouer and beſides the thing which the Papiſts imagine, that we may partly obtaine to be righteous,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13060:94"/>and ſo conſequently bee pardoned at Gods hand, they are too too groſSecondly deceiued, bicaly deceiued in their ſatisfactions, and blind alſo, I ſay, in this they are, to thinke themſelues to haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vertues, which God ought to allow and like of. But in very deed they are aſhamed to ſay that their workes doo merite, but that they carry ſome likelihood with them: for, ſay they, although they do not perfectly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet is it meet that God who is iuſt, ſhould accept of that good which they do. Yea but they are ſo farre blinded in their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as that they vnderſtand not their ſinnes, as we haue alreadie ſaid: Againe, they are ſecondly deceiued, bicauſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues able to acquite themſelues by their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions. I will heere forbeare to ſpeake what their ſatisfactions are, becauſe they are moſt fooliſh, whereby they do nothing elſe but prouoke the heauy wrath of God againſt them, thinking to pay him with filthie toyes and trifles, to wit, with ſuperſtitions deuiſed of their owne braine: for what ſatisfactions can we make, to deliuer vs from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? And what is the committing of one ſinne worthie of? Truely we thinke that when wee haue violated the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and haue payd ſome ſmall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, that we haue done inough. Muſt we not thinke that Sathan wholly poſſeſſeth vs,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13060:94"/>when as we become thus arrogant? Now this is the greateſt part of Popiſh doctrine, to be pardoned, when as we haue deſerued rather to be puniſhed. And this proceedeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence, becauſe they think they ſhould be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by their workes: and therefore they ſaie, that this is but coniecturall, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but ſee, that if wee examine our ſelues, we ſhal come ſhort in the end, neither can wee haue that which is requiſite for the making vp of our accountes before God, to ſay that we are diſcharged. But ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this coniecture, they haue another foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh toye in their heads, which is this, why ſay they, if it were true that God fououred vs to day, it may be that hee would not doo ſo to morrow. Now they neuer thinke that faith is alwaies accompanied with hope, and that hope extendeth it ſelfe both in life &amp; death. And we ſee alſo beſides, that there is a farre greater fault, &amp; that is, they neuer looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the laſt article of death, whereof we will ſpeake (God willing) hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will at this time go on with that wee haue begun, which is, they thinke to ſatisfie and appaiſe God, when as they bring with them ſome recompence for the ſinnes &amp; ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities which they haue committed. Wherin they robbe God of his honor: for, if it were ſo, then hee alone were not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13060:95"/>vs vnto God his father. Now it is not without cauſe that he is called our ranſome: for hee made himſelfe our ſuretie vpon this condition, that hee tooke vpon him to paie our debtes fully and wholly. And therefore whoſoeuer will now take vpon him to paie GOD, vſurpeth the office of Ieſus Chriſt, which is a moſt abhominable abuſe. And yet the Papiſts build their ſaluation hereon. But for all this they cauill and ſaie, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath obteined pardon as wel for the ſinne as for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof, yet notwithſtanding that this is reſerued: although they manifeſtly gainſaie themſelues. For on the other ſide they ſaie, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath not merited for vs, but is the occaſion of merit. Now as I haue alreadie ſaid, they will ſay that wee are by nature ſo ill and ſo exceeding wicked, as that we can do nothing which God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: but ſay that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he giueth vs the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of merit, &amp; this they call the firſt merit, ſo that they giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſome litle gobet or ſmall portion, and to our ſelues the chiefe. Now if it be ſo that Ieſus Chriſt hath onely merited the occaſion of merit, that is to ſay, that wee muſt by him come to heauen, it muſt needs folow, that we ſhall be alwaies bound vnto God as well for the punishment, as for the ſin. And this is an
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13060:95"/>enormious abomination, when as the papiſts wil preſume thus to diſcharge themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with their ſatisfactions. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as one miſchiefe draweth on another, euen ſo thruſt they themſelues into a moſt weariſome labyrinth: for they know well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that if we ſtrained our ſelues to do an hundreth times more then wee are able, yet could wee in no wiſe content &amp; ſatisfie God for our ſins. And why ſo? becauſe we come ſo ſhort in doing that we ſhould, as is moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>What man is he that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his ſins.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.12.</note> And therfore although we ſhuld take neuer ſo much pain to make ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſhall the Papiſts be enforced to ſay, that we are neuer able to come to the end of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet is there alſo a third error amongſt them, to wit, their indulgences &amp; pardons of ful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, for the pardoning of their ſins, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will buy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet they think it not inogh that they haue theſe indulgences, but muſt alſo haue their purgatory to make vp their mouth withal for altogither, ſo as they are ſo maſhed in errors as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they cannot tel how to wind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſeeing they haue all at once ſtraied from the pure ſimplicitie of the holy ſcripure, the diuell hath ſo poſſeſſed &amp; entrapped them within ſuch nets and ſnares, as that they can neuer get out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:13060:96"/>vnto this doctrine which excludeth all ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; ſendeth vs to our lord Ieſus chriſt, to finde that in him which is wanting in vs. Moreouer, we are to note for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this point, what it is to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the meere grace of God, and for faith to be imputed vnto vs for righteouſnes, and that cannot be vnderſtood vntill wee lie at the point of death: for, when as the Papiſts ſpeake of their merites, ſatisfactions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, they may prattle and iangle as it pleaſeth them: but when hipocrites ſhall be ſo drunken and hard harted againſt God, as to be made to beleeue maruels and wonders all their life long, the diuel ſoone after remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them with a witnes, when as they muſt in good earneſt come before the iudge. For we ſee how blockiſh we are, and ſo long as it pleaſeth God to graunt vs life, wee imagine him to be ſuch a one as pleaſeth our ſelues, &amp; transfigure him as we luſt: but when we muſt depart this life, and come before his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate, at whom the Angels themſelues are afeard and tremble, Alas, how ſhall wee moſt miſerable mortall creatures doo in this caſe. And therfore when we ſpeak of this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith, the queſtion is not of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church of God only, but our hope muſt be inuincible, to fight againſt all the temptations of Satan, but eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:13060:96"/>wee muſt come to anſwere before God, wee muſt then ſtand firme and ſure againſt all the feares wherwith we may be ſtirred &amp; driuen vnto. And this is no ſpeculatiue doctrine, but a doctrine of practiſe. True it is, that the holy ſcripture muſt inſtruct vs, but no longer then vntill ſuch time as God hath in verie deed aſsigned vs a day, and our conſciences bound to appear to heare the ſentence of the heauenly iudge. No doubt of it, we wil make but a ſport in reaſoning of this matter. But the practiſe thereof as I haue alreadie ſayd, will teach vs another maner of leſſon, what it is, that is to ſay, we muſt wholly flie vnto the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he is our Aduocate, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelues that God will not enter into judgement with vs. And why ſo? becauſe we are pardoned not according to the draught of our inditement, but by putting away all our ſinnes &amp; iniquitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And this is it which we are to remember concerning this poynt. It ſhould ſeeme now that we cannot be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, if our righteouſnes conſiſteth onely of ſaith: for, our faith, as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaid, will alwaies be weake ſo long as we liue here. And therfore how is it poſsible that wee ſhould bee fully righteous before God? For the effect cannot bee aboue the cauſe. For if we had but halfe a Sunne, wee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13060:97"/>ſhould not haue ſo much light as wee haue; and therfore we muſt haue a whole Sun, that the beames thereof might ſpred it ſelf all the world ouer. Wherefore when faith is thus weake in vs, it ſhould ſeeme that we were but partly acceptable vnto God, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, that hee liked vs not: howbeit we are here to note, that we are not iuſtified by the power and vertue of faith; neither muſt wee thinke it to bee ſo perfect, as to ſaie that our ſaluation is perfect thereby. For, to ſpeake properly, it is God alone that iuſtifieth vs, as out of the eighth of the Romanes wee haue heard. And this is that iuſtification whereof Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in his third Chapter, to wit, <hi>That God ſo loued the world, as that he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his onely begotten Sonne, to the ende that ſo manie as ſhould beleeue in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but ſhould paſse from death to life.</hi> Thus wee ſee to ſpeake properly, that it is GOD alone which iuſtifieth vs: agreeing with that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the fifth Chpiter of the ſecond to the Corinths, ſaying, <hi>That God appeared in Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13060:97"/>not vnto vs our ſinnes. And thus much as touching the definition of the word. And yet wee are taught, that it is the proper office of God to iuſtifie vs. For he ſaith, that he was in Ieſus Chriſt in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilng the world vnto himſelfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, that is to ſaie, hee alloweth and liketh of vs: why then is it ſayd, that faith iuſtifieth? Forſooth, euen this way: for if wee did looke vnto the principall cauſe, and ſought out who is the Authour of our ſaluation, wee would ſtill ſaie, that GOD of his meere goodnes iuſtifieth vs, becauſe hee hath mercie vppon vs, imputeth not our ſinnes, but pardoneth vs. Now it is Ieſus Chriſt alſo that for his part iuſtifieth vs, becauſe hee is the verie true matter of our iuſtification. Where then muſt we ſeeke after it. In the waſhing of his blood which hee ſhed for vs, in the ſacrifice which hee offered for the recompence of our ſinnes, in that hee rendered full obedience, in ſuch ſort,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.</note> as that all our offences are buried and blotted out, becauſe hee was ſanctied for vs, as in the ſeuenteenth of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> it is ſaide. Thus then we ſee, after what maner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Ieſus Chriſt iuſtifieth vs. Now in that it is ſaide, that faith iuſtifieth vs, is not by reaſon of the power and venue that is in it, or for anie woorthineſſe that it hath.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13060:98"/>And herein it is, that the Papiſts are de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for they make a compariſon betweene faith and workes, and ſay, how is it that faith iuſtifieth more then loue? For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Loue is greater then Faith.</hi> True it is, that they miſtake this place: but admit, that loue were more worthy then faith. For we do not now ſpeake about ſuch trifling toyes, as to ſay, that hee were worthie to be the greateſt king in the world, that could may nure and dreſſe the ground as wel as any husband man or vine-dreſſer. And euen ſo fareth it with faith, for, it iuſtifieth vs not as I haue already ſaid, for any excellency that is in it ſelfe, but becauſe it borroweth that of Ieſus Chriſt which is wanting in vs. And therefore is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the righteouſnes of faith ouerthroweth and maketh voyd all the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of workes, and whatſoeuer worldly glory elſe.</hi> And therefore the Papiſts are herein too too blockiſh, and wee for our partes are ſo much the rather to reſt vpon this point which we haue already ſpoken of, that is to ſay, that we are iuſtified by faith, to wit, that the way to make vs to bee acceptable vnto God is, to haue vs laie open a ready way vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that thereby hee may applie his righteouſnes vnto our ſelues. Here wee ſee then, that faith is the only meane and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but that God is the cauſe and author,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13060:98"/>and that all praiſe belongeth vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the right and true matter and ſubſtance thereof. And this is it that we are here to remember. And conſequently, we ſee alſo that the Papiſts do too too foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly cauill to ſay, that faith it ſelf is a worke, and that if we be iuſtified by faith, that then workes are not excluded. And to proue their matter withall, they alledge that which is written in the ſixt of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.29.</note> 
               <hi>This is the worke that God requireth of you, that you belieue in his only Sonne:</hi> Now Ieſus in this place, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth faith a worke, as if he ſhould haue ſayd, you ſee whereat you muſt ayme, and applie your whole ſtudie: for the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not that the worke ſhould merit. And beſides, if wee did confeſſe that faith were a worke, which indeed it is not, yet iuſtifieth it not as a work done by vs: for if I giue almes, and pretend therby to merit before God, ſee how I ſhuld bee iuſtified by my woorkes: if I helpe my neighbour, and trauell to do good vnto this man or vnto that, as they ſhall haue neede: Loe how I ſhould be iuſtified by my workes. Now the reaſon is cleane contrarie in faith: for in confeſsing that we are all accurſed, and that by faith we receiue that which God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vnto vs, we bring nothing with vs on our behalf, but come empty fiſted vnto him. Faith then iuſtifieth, not by bringing anie
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13060:99"/>worthines or merit with it vnto God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God receiueth from Ieſus Chriſt that which hee preſenteth vnto him in our name. And this confeſsion muſt goe before, that there is nothing in them which keepe ſuch a courſe, that is to ſaie, to demand righteouſnes at Gods hands, wherof they are vtterly void. And therefore we ſee that the Papiſts herein deale verie fooliſhly, to ſay that we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a worke, if ſo bee wee bee iuſtified by faith. Now faith is a ſacrifice wherewith God is pleaſed, becauſe he is thereby honored, and praiſe and thankes rendred vnto him, who is only iuſt and good: and yet are we not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by the power and vertue thereof. To be ſhort, when God iuſtifieth vs by faith, there is in this iuſtifying encloſed the grace which hee beſtoweth vpon vs, becauſe hee will not ſee and behold the infirmitie which is in our faith. Faith then iuſtifieth: but yet as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue and imperfect, and yet therein it iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth. How can that be, being defectiue and imperfect? Yes well inough: for as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaid, it is not required at the hand of faith to do any ſuch thing, as hauing power of it ſelfe to iuſtifie, but receiueth ſimply that which is giuen it to doo it, from God. And therefore if wee haue but the leaſt ſparke of faith as a man would ſaie, with this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is no life in vs but that which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13060:99"/>we haue in Ieſus Chriſt: and that all fulneſſe is in him, from whom we draw that which we haue, and wherwith we are filled, without all doubt, we haue then inough. Wherefore let let vs learne ſo to belieue in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as that when ſoeuer we ſhall ſtand in doubt, wee yet neuer ceaſe to ſubmit our ſelues vnto his mercy which can neuer faile, and continually flie vnto him, knowing right well that all perfection of righteouſnes is in him, and is ſuch alſo as that we ſhall be made partakers thereof, and that although we had but the leaſt drop of faith as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and were enuironed and laden with this huge heape of corruption and ſinne that is in vs, whiche bringeth nothing elſe with it but death, yet if Ieſus Chriſt be in vs, there is life: that is to ſay, the reſt of the infirmities and corruption of our fleſh, &amp; whatſoeuer els that may hinder our ſaluation, ſhall all bee abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the ſpirit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, if we haue neuer ſo litle a portion, we ſhalbe of whom ſure to liue for euer.</p>
            <p>Let vs now proſtrate our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our ſinnes, beſeeching him to make vs feele the power and vertue which hee hath giuen vnto his onely ſonne, that we might thereby be drawne and wholly cleaue vnto him. And that wee may learne to be gathered togither
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13060:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>vnder the confidence which hee hath giuen vs in him, fighting againſt all our infirmities, and in the meane while, that all preſumption and pride be caſt downe in vs, and that there remaine nothing elſe in vs, but to confeſſe that as he is iuſt, ſo alſo that it belongeth to him to poure out his righteouſnes vpon vs, to the ende wee may enioy the fruite which proceedeth thereof, to wit, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the heauenly life.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13060:101"/>good that we able to thinke or doo, yet could we in no wiſe accuſe him of crueltie: And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe they may be alwaies amended: and yet doth hee accept of that which is not worthie the acceptation, &amp; al becauſe he acknowledgeth vs for his children, and alſo vpholdeth vs as by his Prophet is ſaide. If then wee aske why God alloweth of our weake affection in ſeruing of him? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beareth with vs, and would not haue vs marked as mercenarie and hired men, but contenteth himſelfe to ſee vs ſerue him frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and freelie, none otherwiſe than as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall father requireth at the handes of his childe. For although a childe ſhall marre that which his father ſetteth him to doo, yet is the father glad when as he hath ſeene that in very deede his meaning was to doo it well. Euen ſo fareth it with our good God, who bearing a fatherly loue vnto vs, forgetteth whatſoeuer defect is in our workes and will not call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>Here (I ſay) wee ſee in ſumme, how that ouer and beſides our perſons wee are iuſtified alſo by that we doo, that is to ſay, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth both of our ſelues and of our workes alſo as righteous. And let vs alſo ſee from whence this word <hi>Reward</hi> whereof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo often ſpeaketh proceedeth: For God ſheweth not onely in the lawe, but alſo in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13060:101"/>Goſpell, that they which ſerue him faithfully ſhall not loſe their labour, nor be fruſtrate of their hope. And why ſo? Verily becauſe their <hi>Reward</hi> is ſurely laide vp in heauen. But how can this agree with that which wee haue alreadie ſaid? That is, that if our works iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs, then muſt faith and the promiſes (as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>be of none effect.</hi> Now wee ſhall ſee them agree right well together, when as one of them ſhall depend vpon another: But if we ſhall on the one ſide put our works in one bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and the grace of God in another, without doubt we ſhall find great contrarietie. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, when as wee ſay e that God hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon vs, becauſe wee are ſinners: and that when hee hath regenerated vs by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that hee alloweth and liketh of the good which he hath put in vs, albeit it be nothing in reſpect of the ill that remaineth. When we ſhal ſpeake after this manner, it is as much as if wee ſhould ſay, that firſt God is mercifull vnto vs, and doth not impute vnto vs our ſinnes and iniquities, but adopteth vs who were loſt and damned ſoules, to bee his children. And in the ſecond place, it is ſaid that hee iuſtifieth vs alſo by our works, and that becauſe he is mercifull and will not iudge vs rigorouſlie, neither regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them what they are, to eſteeme of them as worthy or meritorious: But dealeth in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe as a natural louing father doth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13060:102"/>in I ſay,<note place="margin">Math. 9.13 1. Tim. 1.13 2. Tim. 1. Tit. 3.5.</note> is no repugnancie. And ſo although our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>hee came to call ſinners and not the righteous,</hi> and although ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>that he came to call ſinners to ſaluation,</hi> and that it is not for any workes that we haue done, that the inheritance of the kingdome of heauen is prepared for vs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is louing and kinde vnto vs, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to beſtowe his infinite goodnes vpon vs: and yet for all this receiue we reward; that is to ſay, that when we haue ſerued God, we ſhall be rewarded, as oftentimes it is ſaide in the holy Scripture. Thus we ſee that after this ſort theſe two places which ſeeme to be repugnant one to another, agree very wel together, that is, that <hi>by Faith we are imputed righteous,</hi> and that the zeale which <hi>Phine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Heere wee ſee when <hi>Phinees</hi> the Prieſt ſawe ſo infamous and deteſtable an act to bee committed by an Adulterer and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſe in the Sanctuarie as could not bee a greater, and ſuch a villanie as the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of in Iſraell, that the Lord ſo armed him as that he ſlewe them both: and it is ſaide that <hi>it was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes.</hi> Now this was a vertuous worke: and therefore ſhuld ſeeme that he was not iuſtified by faith; but yet as I haue already ſaide, this may very
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13060:102"/>well hang together. For <hi>Phinees</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Abram,</hi> and therefore God muſt be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him as well as vnto the reſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God holpe him, and was reconciled vnto him by that grace which hee beſtoweth vpon all his choſen, euen vnder the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wee ſee that God reputed it as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke. And how ſo? verily that forſomuch as there was ſome imperfection and weakenes in him, therefore muſt God as I haue already ſaide, ſupport him. Let vs alſo heare what ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, which is this,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>that wee muſt labour powerfullie to ſerue God, for the hopes ſake which is laid vp for vs in heauen, of which hope we haue heard before in the word of truth of the Gospell,</hi> where ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth that the faithfull more couragiouſly and vehemently goe on to ſerue and honour God, and giue themſelues to bee charitable; becauſe they right well knowe that <hi>they ſhall not looſe their labour,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Yea, but how know they that? Forſooth by the teſtimonie of the Goſpell. Now what are the words of the Goſpel? Verily,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> that <hi>God will bee mercifull vnto vs, if ſo wee beleeue in his onelie ſonne:</hi> For the righteouſnes which is there offered vs, as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, hath borne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the law: But is not holpen by the law: that is to ſay, by whatſoeuer works we are able to doo. But becauſe wee are grounded on the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: This Text
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13060:103"/>then ſheweth vs, that the faithfull may bee a great deale better and more earneſtly diſpoſed to ſerue God, becauſe they knowe that their paines ſhall be accepted: And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they reſt themſelues vpon this free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is promiſed them, becauſe they flie vnto our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Heere wee ſee how groſly the Papiſts are deceiued. For from this word <hi>Reward,</hi> they draw the word <hi>Merite,</hi> as if they would play the Alcumiſtes. Now there is great difference betweene the one and the other: For what importeth this word <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</hi> To <hi>Merite,</hi> is to make God bound vnto vs, that we might ſay, I haue wel deſerued this thing or that; I am worthy of it: And he which doth not acknowledge the <hi>Merite,</hi> is vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if hee diſcharge his duetie vnto him, vnto whom he is bound and beholden. If we could then deſerue any thing at Gods handes, it muſt needs follow, that he for his part ſhould he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto vs, and doo vs wrong if he paid vs not that which he ought vs. True it is that he is pur debtor; but a voluntary debtor: For hee ſhall neuer find any thing in vs why hee ſhould be beholden vnto vs; but bindeth himſelfe by his promiſes. Now in very deede hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vs <hi>Reward,</hi> but it is of his owne free gift, and of no deſert of ours: for that were to come from a poſte to a pudding-prick, to go ſo from one to another, and to conclude that theſe two
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13060:103"/>words are all one, where there is ſo great diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. Wherefore let vs not meruaile though the Papiſtes ſtill conclude their Arguments thus, and ſtorme when we ſay, <hi>That works cannot iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vs.</hi> For their ſuppoſall is falſe, that is to ſay, that if GOD rewardeth thoſe that are his, that therefore he is bound to doo it, and that they are alſo worthy of it, and that their workes import ſome <hi>Merite;</hi> Nowe all this is not worth a ſtraw. The reaſon I haue alredy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, that when God promiſeth vs <hi>Reward</hi> it is not becauſe that wee are worthy thereof, but becauſe it pleaſeth him to adde grace vnto grace, and all of his meere mercie, goodnes and liberalitie. Now we are alwaies to keepe this in minde: and in very deede what ſhould we look for at his hands, if we had nothing but that that we deſerue? Aſſuredly, we ſhould be driuen to that vnquietnes vvhereof vvee erſt ſpake, that vve ſhould alvvaies bee in doubt and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore our faith muſt bee certaine. And this is that in ſumme vvhich heere vve are to remember.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come vnto the wordes of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> who ſeemeth to be contrarie vnto <hi>S. Paul</hi> and all the reſt of the holie Scriptures, as we haue alreadie ſpoken:<note place="margin">Iames. 2.24.</note> For <hi>Saint Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>That we are not iuſtified by faith, but by workes.</hi> A man would thinke that there could not be found two places more contrarie one
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13060:104"/>to the other, as to ſay, <hi>That we are iuſtified by faith onely, without works,</hi> and <hi>that we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by workes, and not by faith,</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is moſt certaine that <hi>S. Iames,</hi> who ſpake by the ſpirite of God, gainſaid not the doctrine which was preached and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the beginning in the Church, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Prophets, and which hath beene laſtly more notably confirmed by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and by his Apoſtles. Howbeit the ſolution is verie eaſie, when as wee ſhall looke into the drift and meaning of <hi>S. Iames:</hi> For he reaſoneth not there what true faith may do, neither doeth he ſpeake at all of true faith, but of a counterfait faith, and ſuch as is but like vnto an image and an illuſion. For he reaſoneth there againſt ſuch as vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Chriſtianitie will take libertie to do al wickednes, as at this daye there are too too many. And beſides, the diuel doth ſo beſtirre himſelfe to blind vs, as he would make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that all our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, and ſo vnder the name of Chriſtianitie would make vs become verie brutiſh, and thereby peruert all. And to bring alſo the doctrine of the Goſpell &amp; profeſſors into a ſlaunder, to the end alſo it might be thought, that the doctrine of the Goſpell did ouerthrow good workes, &amp; would not haue vs worſhip and ſerue God, as the Papiſtes at this day deſpitefully reproche
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13060:104"/>vs therewithall. VVherefore <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſeeing many diſſolute and profane people thus falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe the name of the Goſpell, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the name Faith: He ſaith, well, <hi>Let mee ſee thy faith without workes, and I will ſhewe thee my faith by my workes:</hi> whereby he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſheweth, that his meaning was not to ſpeake of ſuch a faith as we haue defined: that is; that we ſhould be certaine and ſure of the goodnes of God by his word, and knowe him to be our Father through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Now <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſpeaketh not of ſuch a faith as this is; and that which is not ſuch a one, cannot bring foorth workes. VVe haue alreadie ſaid; that by faith we receiue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And he and his ſpirite cannot be ſeparated. And wee knowe that it is ſaid, <hi>That it is not giuen vnto vs onely for righteouſnes, but for ſanctification alſo:</hi> that is to ſay; that wee might be purged of all the filthie luſtes of our fleſh, <hi>That we might be made like vnto the righteouſnes of God.</hi> So then if <hi>S. Iames</hi> had ſpoken of this true faith, it had beene great follie for him to haue ſaid, <hi>Shewe me thy faith without workes,</hi> and <hi>I will ſhewe thee my faith by my worlds:</hi> as iſ he would haue ſaid; that true faith is ſo conioyned with good workes, as without them it is dead, to wit; it is no faith, as afterward he ſaith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>S. Iames</hi> right well ſheweth, that he ſpake
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13060:105"/>not of a faith which embraceth the promiſes of God, and by which we are certified of our ſaluation. And herein the Papiſtes do groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe them-ſelues, to forge vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a faith, which they call vnformed; that is to ſay, without figure or ſhape, and ſay; that faith of it ſelfe is as it were but like a piece of earth or claye which a man ſhoulde take to dawbe withall. Here yee ſee (ſay they) what faith is. And beſides, they ſaie, that when Charitie is conioyned thereto, then it is like a pot that is made of the ſame piece or lump of earth, which before had no forme or faſhion. Thus wee ſee what a iolly imagination the Papiſtes haue, whereby they declare that they know not what faith is: For it is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſingular gift of God. And after it is ſaid. <hi>That we receiue the ſpirite of adoption,</hi> by which he ſo renueth and alſo incorporateth vs into our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as that wee are made members of his bodie, and withall newe creatures. VVee ſee then that the Papiſtes knowe not theſe things, neither yet vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the principles and rudiments of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie no more than brute beaſtes without ſence. And vvhat a feareful thing is this that they do nothing elſe but brag of theſe things: And yet they thinke themſelues to be the greateſt diuines in the vvorld, vvhen as they haue made a diſtinction forſooth; betvveene
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13060:105"/>vnformed and formed faith: vvhich is as much as if they had ſaid; a God in vvhome is no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver nor vertue, &amp; then a God who ſhevveth himſelfe povverfull and iuſt. And thus haue they forged vnto themſelues a double faith.</p>
            <p>And vvhy then doeth <hi>S. Iames</hi> vſe here this vvord? And vvhy do vvee vſe this vvorde, <hi>Church?</hi> This vvorde <hi>Biſhop?</hi> this ſaying <hi>Gods ſeruice? Deuotion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zeale?</hi> But vvhen vve ſpeake of the Papiſtes, vve neuer yeelde vnto them in truth that they haue any church vvhich is to be obeyed: For in deed they haue nothing but ſome ruynes of a Church, and a certaine canuaſsing and toſsing of ſeruice of their ovvn deuiſing, and (as they thought) to ſerue God vvithall. But that is the Church vvhere God dvvelleth by his vvorde. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard, vvhen vvee ſpeake of them, vvee vſe honourable vvordes, and yet our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is none other, but that they vſurpe theſe titles vvith iolly ſhevves &amp; markes. Hovvbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it vvee do not altogether ſtand vpon vvords. And after this manner dealeth <hi>S. Iames:</hi> for he ſtandeth not vpon the vvorde, but taketh vpon him to ſpeake of the friuolous vaunting vvhich vvas in the mouth of theſe ſcoffers that vvould be taken for good Chriſtians, &amp; ſaith, your faith; that is to ſaie: that faith vvhich you talke of is nothing: As if vvee ſhould aske the queſtion at this day: vvhat is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13060:106"/>the Catholicke Church vvhich the Papiſts ſo bragge of? Surely it is a very harlot. For vve knovve that the true Church is the ſpouſe of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, vvhich ought to bee purged and vvaſhed vvith his bloud,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.27 1. Tim. 3.15.</note> that ſhe might bee as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith vvithout ſpot or vvrinkle, and after that to bee the piller of truth: And in ſteede hereof; beholde a den of the eues, and an harlot vvhich hath corrupted all the ſeruice of God, and begot nothing but Baſtards. Thus ſhould vve ſay, and then vvee ſee that vvee ſhould not thinke ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> his phraſe of reaſoning to be ſtrange, becauſe it is an ordinarie and common thing amongſt vs. VVe novv then firſt ſee, that vvhen it is ſaide that Faith iuſtifieth vs, vve ſpeake not of Faith but after the accuſtomed manner. But vvhen ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith that faith vvithout vvorks is dead, it is to barre ſuch as abuſe this name and haue a iollitie to bragge and glorie thereof: but in deede haue it not. Let vs come novv to the ſecond part, vvhen ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith that vvee are iuſtified by our vvorkes, it ſhould by this ſeeme that hee is contrary vnto ſaint <hi>Paul.</hi> Novv vvorkes muſt not be ioined vvith faith to part halfe ſtakes vvith it, as vve haue already ſaid: For if that vvere ſo, then vvee ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee certaine and ſure. And therefore all conſideration of our vvorkes muſt needes bee excluded, or the calling vpon God vvith true
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13060:106"/>confidence, to bee taken for his children, to hope for the inheritance of the heauenly life vvhich is promiſed vs, vvorks muſt needes be laid aſide; for vvhat vvere it if vvorks iuſtified. Novv this vvorde <hi>Iustifie</hi> is not taken in ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> to be approoued before God, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs vnto him, and to make him receiue vs as his children . Hovve is it then taken? Euen as himſelf declareth it vvithout any other expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For he addeth that <hi>Abram</hi> vvas iuſtified vvhen hee vvent about to offer vp in ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>Iſahack.</hi> Novv vvee neuer yet read that he ſacrificed him, to vvit, that he meant to make a ſacrifice of his ſonne vnto God: vvhat meant hee then? Forſooth this, obedience, vvhereof vvee ſhall hereafter ſpeake, vvas it that iuſtified <hi>Abram.</hi> If vvee did ſpeake of the approouing of that vvhich he had at that time done, and vvas yet not indeede done: VVee muſt therefore conclude that ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not in that place, hovv vvee are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God; but how vve are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For vvhat a blockiſh ſpeech vvere this to ſay that the ſonne had begotten the Father. Novv vvee right vvell knovv that faith is the mother of righteouſnes, that is to ſay, that it is the meane and inſtrument by vvhich vve are reconciled vnto God, and allovved for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And therefore faith muſt go before righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: for it is the meane cauſe, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13060:107"/>or formall cauſe as vve call it.</p>
            <p>Let vs novv come vnto the obedience of <hi>Abram</hi> vvhen he vvas readie to ſacrifice his ſonne: for if that be the cauſe of <hi>Abram</hi> his righteouſnes, it muſt needes be that it vvent before: For vvhat a doltiſh ſpeach vvere this, to ſay, that the corne that ſhall grovve a yere hence ſhall feede me from this day vntill this time tvvelue monethes. Novve there is not the leaſt childe in the vvorld vvhich ſeeth not this. Novv, there vvas a long time part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God commaunded <hi>Abram</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne, and yet vvas he iuſtified before. VVe ſee then, in ſumme, that vve neede not to looke for any gloſe out of ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> his vvords; he ſaith, that he vvas iuſtified, that is to ſay, that he vvas ſhevved to be iuſtified: For theſe Scoffers againſt vvhom hee contendeth ſaide, vvee are iuſtified by faith, and therefore vvhat need vve to take any great care to ſerue God, ſeeing our vvorkes are of no vvorth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any reckoning bee made of them in time to come. Novv firſt and formoſt they peruert all in ſaying, that there ſhall bee no reckoning made of vvorks: For they ſhal come in account vvith the grace of God. But vvhen they ſhall ſcoffingly ſay, that it is to no purpoſe to doo good vvorks, is as much as if they vvould teare Ieſus Chriſt in pieces. For by faith vve receiue him, and are vnited vnto him vvith this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13060:107"/>that he reconcileth vs vnto his father, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth avvay our ſinnes, and regenerateth and gouerneth vs by his holy ſpirit. And theſe are inſeparable thinges as vve haue alleaged out of ſaint <hi>Paul.</hi> Seeing then it is ſo, ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> had good cauſe to ſay, <hi>how can you be iustified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works? For Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>without workes is dead.</hi> And beſides, if you bee the faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, you can be none othervviſe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than your father <hi>Abram</hi> vvas. Novve <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> vvas ſo iuſtified as that good vvorkes vvere ioyned vvith Faith; And therefore you muſt ſhevve your ſelues like vnto him, or elſe you mocke God, in prophaning ſo holy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a thing as the name of faith and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is. Here vve ſee ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> his meaning out of this Text: But theſe Popiſh maſtiue Curres can no vvhit skill of this, and vvhat is the reaſon? Verily becauſe they contemne God: hovvbeit you ſhall heare them vvith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth talke of good vvorkes, and a man vvoulde thinke, to heare them debate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they vvere Angels, and yet you may ſee vvhat they are. And I vvould to God that the vvhole ſtate of their life vvere not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſolute; for a man ſhall finde neither Monke nor Fryar, Doctor, nor yet any of that ſhorne Rable, but they are either rybauldes, skorners of God, vvhoremongers, drunkards, blaſphemers: To bee ſhort, it ſhoulde ſeeme
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13060:108"/>that they had conſpired vvith the Diuell to bring the vvhole vvorld vnto confuſion. And yet for all this they vvil pretend good vvorks, and ſpeake of nothing elſe. And therefore it is no meruaile although they bee ſo blind. But to ſpeak but a vvord of that vvhich vve haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed out of ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> vve are to note, that vve ar iuſtified but not vvithout vvorks, &amp; yet vve are iuſtified vvithout vvorks: vvhen vve ſay that vvee are iuſtified, but not vvithout vvorkes, vve ſeparate not this. And hovv ſo? verily, becauſe that he vvho is iuſtified before God by faith, is as much to ſay; that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth him his ſinnes; beleeueth in the paſsion and death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that by his reſurrection, he receiueth life from him. So then, vvhoſoeuer beleeueth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort, is not iuſtified vvithout vvorkes. And vvhy? Becauſe that God beſtovveth his holie ſpirit vpon him, vvhich ſo reformeth him, as that good vvorkes cannot be choſen but be ioyned together vvith faith. And yet is the other ſaying alſo true, to vvite, that vve are iuſtified vvithout vvorkes; that is to ſaie, vvithout any helpe of good vvorkes, ſo as vve alvvaies remain bound vnto God.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13060:108"/>without works,</hi> howbeit the meaning is, that works are not for all this the cauſe of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to make them merite any whit before God, ſo as to accept vs according to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines: But it is becauſe that as I haue already ſaid, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt beareth vs not onely a ſimple grace and fauour, but a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is to ſay: that on the one ſide he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all our iniquities and offences through his pure obedience, and appeaſeth the wrath of God his father by that Sacrifice which hee offered vp once for all, to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes: And yet hee ſo ruleth and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs in the meane while by his holy ſpirite whome hee hath receiued in all fulnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vpon him, that if ſo be we doo not abuſe his grace beſtowed vpon vs, we are freed from the bands of Sathan, that we might take good heede as (S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>not to follow the luſts and deſires of the fleſh.</hi> This then wee ſee may ſuffice for the expoſition of this place. Nowe <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth immediately following, that God ſpake againe vnto <hi>Abram,</hi> and ſaid: <hi>I am the Lord which brought thee out of Vr of the Chaldees to giue thee this Land to inherite it.</hi> Here we ſee that God reitereateth his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the confirming, nouriſhing and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abram</hi> his faith vntill ſuch time as it was growne vnto a full perfection. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon wee are to conclude, that although
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13060:109"/>
               <hi>Abram</hi> was the mirrour and patterne of all the faithfull, and the very Image of righteouſnes, yet was his faith imperfect: For elſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that is here ſet downe, were ſuperfluous. For if the faith of <hi>Abram</hi> was ſo throughly confirmed as that it coulde not bee amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; God needed not to haue ſpoken any more.</p>
            <p>And why ſo? The promiſes haue this vſe and benefit that they draw vs vnto faith, and when wee haue gotten it, they are to leade vs to the right way, to incourage and ſtirre vs vp to goe on valiantly, to refreſh vs when we are almoſt weary, to augment our vertue when it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to faile and to be weake. Here (I ſay) we ſee why our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt teſtifieth &amp; declareth vnto vs of his meere goodnes that he is our God: that is, to begin faith in vs; or els to bring it to perfection. And therefore wee muſt conclude that it was needfull for <hi>Abram</hi> to goe ſomewhat further. And hereby we ſee that although our faith be vnperfect, yet that God ceaſeth not to iuſtifie vs. And what is the reaſon? Becauſe he imputeth not the infirmity that is in it vnto vs: but how euer it is, wee are here admoniſhed by this place not to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by any fooliſh opinion of our owne, as a great many of men are, who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ſuch great Clarks, as that they will not once vouchſafe to come any more vnto
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13060:109"/>the ſchoole of God. Let vs therefore vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know: that although our faith were greater and more powerfull than now it is; yet muſt wee be ſchollers all our life long to haue the word of God ſounding in our cares, and to haue our memories rubbed ouer &amp; refreſhed, that we might not forget that which wee haue learned; that that which hath not taken deepe roote in our heartes, may receiue a better and deeper impreſſion: and that God when he hath caſt his ſeede into vs (according to ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> his compariſon) wee may daily water it in vs: For, it were not inough to haue the ſeede caſt into the grounde without God ſhoulde ſende downe raine from heauen and bedewe it: for when the husband-man ſhall haue done his duety in tilling the lande, it is to no purpoſe without GOD ſhould giue increaſe thereof from heauen. Euen ſo muſt it bee with vs when as wee ſhall haue receiued the ſeede of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible life, GOD muſt raine downe from heauen; that is to ſay, hee muſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally benefite and ſtrengthen our faith: which cannot be except we be daily inſtructed from his mouth. Let vs nowe come to the contents of this ſentence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am the Lord which brought the out of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the chaldees.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:13060:110"/>
            <p>Theſe words here are inſerted for <hi>Abram</hi> to cauſe him to eſchew all Idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition wherein he had been hertofore brought vp. For as it is often ſhewed vnto vs out of the holy Scripture, that we muſt not worſhip God confuſedly, nor imagine him to bee ſuch a one as we thinke: But wee muſt know what God that is which we muſt flie vnto, and muſt bee ſeparated &amp; diſtinguiſhed from all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations &amp; deuiſes of mans braine, whereby we ſo greatly deceiue our ſelues, and are alſo decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Sathan. And that is the reaſon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the eleuenth Chapter and the ſixth verſe: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When wee will come vnto God, wee muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God is, and that hee is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeeke him.</hi> VVee cannot come then vnto God, except we beleeue that God is, that is to ſay: we muſt not be wauering nor doubtfull; but wee muſt bee firmely and conſtantly aſſured, that that God which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heauen and earth is hee who ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs, and whoſe will wee knowe both by the lawe and Goſpell: and not to reaſon what God is, as the poore heathen haue done, who haue beene ſo maruellouſly tormented about it, and haue runne themſelues ſo farre into ſuch a Labyrinth and Maze, as that they could neuer winde themſelues out of it againe. But we know that God is manifeſted vnto vs
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13060:110"/>in that he is beneficiall vnto vs for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus much for the firſt point. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that he is a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeeke him. Now this word <hi>Rewarder,</hi> importeth not that God rendreth that vnto vs which he ovveth vs, but that vve ſhall not bee fruſtrate in putting our truſt in him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve muſt looke after vvhat manner vvee aske him: For if vvee vvill bring our vvorkes vvith vs; that is euen to kicke againſt God: ſo farre off is it for vs to bee vnited vnto him by that meanes. And ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that vvhen the Ievves thought to truſt in their vvorks and put their hope of ſaluation in them, that they hurt and vndid themſelues: and that vvas the cauſe of their breake necke inſteede of going forvvard. VVherefore if vve vvill ſeeke God aright, vve muſt without all doubt caſt from vs all vaine preſumption of our ovvn ſtrength: For ſeeing he hath adopted vs of his meere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and grace, it is moſt certaine, vve ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be accepted of him, except it bee becauſe hee forgiueth vs our ſinnes. And thus ſaith the Apoſtle, ſhall vve be aſſured; that if vve ſeeke God after this ſort, vvee ſhall neuer bee fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame purpoſe is it ſaide, <hi>I am the Lorde which brought thee out of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Chaldees to giue thee this Lande to inherite it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:13060:111"/>
            <p>This is as much as if God hid bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a newe vnto his ſeruaunt <hi>Abram,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto him that he ſhould not need to feare but that which he before heard ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: and that although the effect thereof was deferred and prolonged a great while, yet muſt hee walke patiently, knowing that God ſpeaketh not in vaine: and beſides that hee hath his times and ſeaſons for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of his will. And that it lyeth in him and in his ſecret counſaile, and is not to be brought to follow our appetites and humours. But yet wee are to note, that God confirmed the faith of <hi>Abram</hi> by his auncient benefites: For hee faith <hi>I brought thee out of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Chaldees.</hi> And this made <hi>Abram</hi> to truſt a great deale more vnto God, whenas he had already found by experience that God was his father and Sauiour. For by how much that we haue heretofore felt pi the goodnes, aide, and helpe of God, by ſo much more ſhould we aſſure our ſelues of him for the time to come. Thus wee ſee how the experience of the time paſt ſhould ſtill more and more aſſure vs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. And this was the pretence of God in ſaying, <hi>I haue brought thee out of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Chaldees:</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide: it is not now onely that I haue ſhewed my ſelfe to bee thy God, but thou haſt felt that I haue vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thee with a mighty &amp; outſtretched arme:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13060:111"/>thou wert vtterly caſt away, and a poore dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoule; and yet did I take thee vnto my ſelf, to the ende to ſaue thee. And therefore ſith I haue pluckt thee out of the bottomleſſe pit of hell, let my grace which thou haſt now felt, be an inuincible fortreſſe vnto thee: and I for my part alſo will ſo continue. No we it is certaine that we haue this generall rule alſo from God, which is, that one grace which hee beſtoweth on vs dravveth another vvith it; For hee is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vveary: and this is a ſpring that can neuer be dravvn dry, &amp; therfore let vs boldly dravv out of it, and vve ſhall bee ſure to find alwaies more and more to fill vs vvithall. Thus then vve ſee what this ſaying importeth, <hi>I am the Lord which brought thee out of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> After that God hath ſet before vs his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and ſhevved himſelfe to bee the maker both of heauen and earth, hee bringeth in this as an eſpeciall matter, vvhich is, that <hi>Abram</hi> had felt and knovvne him to bee ſuch a one, vvhen as hee had pluckt him out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles depth vvherein he vvas, and he addeth <hi>To giue thee this land to inherite it.</hi> Heere (as I haue already ſaid) God renueth all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vvhich he had made to his ſeruant <hi>Abram,</hi> becauſe he ſhould make a collection of them. For faith ought to haue this priuiledg, to heap vp together vvhatſoeuer may defend it againſt all the temptations and aſſaultes of Sathan.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:13060:112"/>
            <p>Here we ſee what the cauſe is of the ruine of a great many of men: that is, their negligence and ſecuritie. For, as I haue already ſaide, they thinke themſelues to be great Doctors, when as they haue learned but one ſentence out of the holy Scripture: yea, they ſuppoſe that they haue euen inough of it. But when they ſhall come to the tryall they vvill ſhew themſelues then to be but empty veſſels: For if the Diuel fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d but the leaſt hole to enter into them, hee will poiſon them with his deadly poiſon: much like vnto a broken tile vppon an houſe, for the raine that ſhall run in at the brokennes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will in proceſſe of time, rot the whole houſe, Euen ſo fareth it with ſuch as think themſelues too too well learned, and yet are in very deede moſt blockiſh dunces: whom the Diuell after finding an hole in, ſo entreth in thereat, as that the houſe falleth quite and cleane vnto the ground. Now we muſt not be weary in profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but make a good big collection of all the promiſes of God, and alwaies haue a feeling of the fruit of them: and not onely ſo, but wee muſt alſo labour continually to increaſe our faith as it is very needfull: becauſe it will euer be weake. And to be ſhort we muſt ſtill go on from f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith to faith. It is ſaid that God gaue the land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> to <hi>Abram:</hi> It was in very deede already giuen him, as we haue heard in the twelfth Chapter.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:13060:112"/>
            <p>And this was reiterated vnto him many times: his eares were now well beaten with it. It ſhould ſeeme then that this was an vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſuperfluous kind of ſpeach. But as I haue alreadie ſaid; this was an ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit vnto <hi>Abram,</hi> whenas he was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and comforted, that hee might not faile, but ſtill follow the holie calling of God. Moreouer, wee are to note, that God enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth him onely with wordes: And herein we ſee what honour we are to beare him, and not diſtruſt him, although we ſee not before our eyes the effect of that which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs; but hold our ſelues ſtil in ſuſpens. He ſaith, I haue brought thee into this land which I gaue thee. VVell, my God, thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to giue it mee in deede: But beholde I am old and drie; when will that time come?</p>
            <p>O, care thou not for that: for I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto thee. VVell, be it ſo. But where is the demonſtration of that which I haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for all this while. For I am at deathes dore, and am here a ſtranger, &amp; haue no ſeede (as hath beene heretofore ſaid) and how ſhal I do then O Lord ? VVell, take my worde for it. This then is the nature of faith: To haue all our ſenſes ſubiect vnto the will of God, and beleeue his trueth. Our eares alſo muſt be open and attentiue to receiue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſpeaketh vnto vs: and that when he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13060:113"/>hath once ſaid the worde; conclude, that it ſhall be ſo. But which way can that be? O, we are not to reaſon that; neither is it in our diſpoſition: But wee muſt leaue it vnto the counſell and will of God, as we haue alreadie ſaid. This then is the honour winch wee muſt do vnto GOD; euen to beleeue his holy worde. More ouer, wee are ſtill to obſerue that which hath heretofore been ſpoken, that is to ſaye: That God ſimply gaue the land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> vnto his ſeruaunt <hi>Abraham</hi> for a pawne, to the end he ſhould not muſe to him ſelfe, nor trouble his head about it: For then had <hi>Abraham</hi> had but a colde pull, if he had had nothing elſe but that land. But without doubt he was led by another ſpirite, which is: Hee ſawe the verie day of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; as in the Goſpell according to <hi>Iohn</hi> it is written. And beſides, he confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be but a Pylgrime here in this world: and therefore looked for his inheritance elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And where it is ſaide: that this lande was giuen him for to inherit; that was not the marke which he ſhot at: his minde was not ſet thereon; but had a further reache. For, by reaſon (as wee haue alreadie ſaide) that hee forſooke his natiue countrey, and left it, to liue in a ſtrange and an vnknowen place: it muſt needes be, that his minde was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupied about:the heuenly inheritance.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13060:113"/>So then we are here to note: that although the lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> is here called his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as alſo Gods houſe and reſting place: yet is it but as a pawne; or to ſpeake more properly, but as an earneſt pennie: For a pawne importeth as much at the leaſt as the full worth of the thing which wee are to be aſſured of. But an earneſt pennie is, as a man would ſaye, nothing. And to giue a pennie, as we call it, vnto God, for a bargaine worth an hundreth thouſand crownes and more is nothing. For of what worth is that piece which wee giue? forſooth of no value. Now, can a potte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> or gallen of wine be worth a great poſſeſsion or lande that is able to enrich three or fouremen? And yet, be as be may, this earneſt pennie is deſtined vnto ſuch an vſe. And therefore this lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> was the inheritance of all the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and of as manie as haue deſcended of his lyne: but yet ſo, as that it vvas but an earneſt penie for heauen: Inſomuch, that the verie faithful looked not ſo much vnto that, neither yet ſet ſo their mindes on it; But ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their cogitations &amp; thoughts a great deale higher. VVe ſee then, vvhether God meant to call <hi>Abram,</hi> as if he had ſaid; that he did him no vvrong in leauing him to languiſh: Becauſe he was ſure that the promiſes ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: &amp; therfore not to ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ovvn vvit. And vvhy ſo?</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:13060:114"/>
            <p>Becauſe he was to looke vnto him that ſpake the worde, who was the vnchangeable God. Now by reaſon that wee our ſelues are ſo changeable as that our mindes alter euery minute; VVee therefore grieue and vexe, when we ſee that God perfourmeth not that at the verie firſt, which he hath promiſed vs. And becauſe wee ſee our liues to be ſo ſhort; and the time wee haue to liue, to be but as a ſhadow which fleeteth ſodainely away; wee thinke that GOD will neuer come time enough: wherefore wee muſt learne to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this fault, by theſe words that wee heare here to be ſpoken to <hi>Abram: I am the Lorde which changeth not.</hi> And beſides, wee heare what is ſaid in other places:<note place="margin">The ſong of Moſes. Pſal. 90.4 2. Pet. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>That a thouſand yeares are but as one day with him.</hi> And <hi>Saint Peter</hi> alſo ſaith: <hi>That in the laſt dayes there ſhall come mockers who ſhall ſay: where is the promiſe of his comming?</hi> as though the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings &amp; promiſes of God were of none effect. No, no, (ſaith he) deceiue not your ſelues: he will accompliſh whatſoeuer he hath ſpoken, though it be late: <hi>For a thouſand yeares with him, are as but one day:</hi> And therefore wee muſt looke a great deale higher, and knowe, that ſith it is the Lord that hath ſaid it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer changeth; that he will do that which he hath ſpoken, but not whenas it pleaſeth vs; but whenas he knoweth it to be beſt: firſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:13060:114"/>for his owne glorie; and next, for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good: neither muſt we be ouer ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, nor yet ouer remiſe and ſlacke; but goe out of our ſelues &amp; come vnto him, in whome is no inconſtancie nor ſhewe of change, for he is the Lorde. And let vs learne thus much: that when hee hath once ſpoken the worde, that it is enough; becauſe his worde is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible trueth.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, let vs acknowledge his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſupporting and bearing with our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes herein, becauſe he ſpeaketh not onely once, but putteth vs ſtill in remembrance of his promiſes: meaning thereby to haue vs profit and be confirmed by them all the dayes of our life; and not beleeue him onely for a day or two, but for euer. And let vs be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and gouerned by his power, not onely all our life long, but euen in death alſo, vntil ſuch time as we are come vnto his kingdom, where we ſhal neuer neede to be more ſpoken vnto; neither haue neede either of Faith or yet any other ſuch like things: For then ſhall we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the full brightnes of that, which wee doe now but ſee in the darke; and ſee him face to face, as it were in a glaſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now proſtrate our ſelues before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our ſinnes; beſeeching him to cauſe vs ſo to feele them, as that they may humble vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13060:116"/>not tarrying vntill ſuch time as hee was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to doo the dutie of a good and faithfull Subiect, but did it without beeing required therevnto: And yet for all this wee contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſee, that it no way letted him to ſerue God truelie.

And that although men be in great authoritie; yet are we to learne, the ſame to be farre inferior vnto the heauenly Maieſtie, which darkeneth and blemiſheth all whatſoeuer excellencie is in man. And this is verie certaine, that if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had meant to gratifie his neighbours, he would haue conformed himſelfe alſo vnto their faſhions, and neuer once haue ſaid that he had a God by himſelfe, whome he would worſhip; forſaking the Idolatries that then were vſed, and the ſuperſtitions wherewith
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13060:116"/>the lande was fully poluted. But come of it whatſoeuer might, he fully proteſted that hee would worſhip and ſerue God ſincerely and purely: wherefore he had, as wee haue heard, an Aultar of his own,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7. and 23.4.</note> vpon which he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrificed vnto God, by meanes whereof he renounced all the ſinnes and corruptions of his neighbours as condemning and deſpiſing them all, as if he would haue ſaid, there is but one onely true ſeruice that pleaſeth God, and but one onely liuing God: and whatſoeuer elſe is beſide, are but meere falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imaginations. And although hee before had no certaine abyding &amp; reſting place, but wandred vp and downe too and fro; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſed he to call vpon God in euery place where euer he came, ſhewing thereby that he no whit liked of the ſinnes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that then bare ſway in the world. But yet there is here one ſpeciall reaſon which afreſh mooued him to call vpon the name of God in this place; and it is this: becauſe hee nowe receiued greater reſt, and felt more benefite and commoditie comming to him ſelfe than euer at any time heretofore. For before that time, he neuer durſt take vpon him to plant any tree: but there he planted many, becauſe he had leaue to dwell quietly there. And as hee honoured and worſhipped an earthly Prince who was King of that countrie. Euen
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13060:117"/>ſo likewiſe ſhewed he therewith, that he had not forgotten his good God; neither yet that his zeale waxed colde: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he held him not alwayes as his chiefe Lorde, although he ſubiected himſelfe vnto him, and was contented to remaine vnder his protection. Thus here wee ſee, namely, why <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh mention, that <hi>Abraham</hi> called vpon the name of the Lord. The lawe for the conſecrating of houſes was not as yet written, and yet he then obſerued it: to wit, he effectually ſhewed, that his houſe was the Temple of God: And ſo muſt alſo all the faithfull ſurely purpoſe to keepe their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place pure and cleane without pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the ceremonie which God commaunded the Iewes to vſe, ceaſeth at this day: to wit, that they ſhould conſecrate their houſes before they occupied them. But the trueth and ende thereof whereunto God had reſpect, is left vnto vs: to wit, that when wee are placed and ſettled, not to vſe them like Cloſets to ſhut out the preſence of GOD, neither yet to take libertie to walke after our owne appetites and luſtes.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing God hath vouchſafed vs this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to graunt vs houſes to dwell in, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſtande in neuer ſo baſe an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corner of a backſide: yet let vs there ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>Nowe it is not meant, that wee ſhoulde dedicate the walles and roofes vnto him; but the whole houſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, to ſay truely: an houſholder ſhoulde firſt of all begin with him ſelfe: and yet hee muſt not forget, neither to haue his wife alſo well inſtructed. And beſides, if God hath beſtowed children and ſeruaunts vpon him; he is to looke, that, they be all held within the obedience of God, as here it is ſaide; that <hi>Abraham</hi> held his houſhold.</p>
               <p>But to ſay truely: this is a thing ſeeldome vſed. For, wee ſee that euery man wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if God be neuer ſo much blaſphemed and contemned , and the houſe ſo profaned, as that there is neither zeale nor yet religion in it, there are no wordes made of it, but all is well. But let them aſſure them ſelues hereof that God will not ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe his right.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:13060:118"/>
               <p>Let vs therefore learne ſo to vſe our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes, as that GOD may there dwell with vs as our chiefe gouernour, and let both great and ſmall, dedicate them ſelues vnto him, and therewithall not onely offer vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him their ſoules, but their bodies alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither let them thinke which cannot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, without it be to the hazarding of their liues, that they are therefore to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed if they honour him not. For, that is the moſt excellent honour that wee owe or can doe vnto him. Neither muſt wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage and ſaye; that wee haue not any ſuch warrant or libertie to hazard our liues. But ſay what we ſay will, that which is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Abrabam,</hi> muſt ſerue vs for an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; becauſe we knowe him to be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of all the faithfull, in as much as he is their father. And therefore ſeeing it is ſo; let vs knowe that although wee dwell euen in the middeſt of the enimies of God and of his trueth, and were preſently to be perſecuted; yet ought wee to make a confeſsion of our Faith: for, wee muſt preferre the principall before the acceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what we haue to learne from this place. Now it is namely ſaide; that hee called vpon the eternall God, the God that gouerneth all the worlde; to wit, of the God that liueth for euer.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:13060:118"/>
               <p>Here <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh, as it were, a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon betweene the alterations and changes which ran in <hi>Abraham</hi> his mind, and between the ſtaidnes of his Faith, which was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and firme, as that he would not change what euer came of it. Here then we ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi> was carried too and fro. Firſt hee altered his dwelling place; yea, and was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen like chaffe before the winde. And yet the caſe (notwithſtanding) was ſuch, that hee knewe he muſt needes ſtill continue, firme &amp; conſtant in God; and his faith to be ſo found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly laide, as that nothing ſhoulde be able to ſhake it, nor yet once a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thus we ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtill followed that courſe which God directed him in. And ſo he worſhipped the eternall God, although it ſeemed that God played with him as with a Tennis Ball, toſsing him this way and that. Now it is ſaid, that he dwelt in the Philiſtins countrey a long while together . But the wordes which <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth, ſignifie, <hi>To dwell as a ſtranger.</hi> And this is a thing well to be noted: For although he was ſuffered peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to dwell there, and was no whit wronged nor violently dealt withall as before time hee had beene: yet for all that he knewe that he was not as yet poſſeſſor and owner of this land: and yet it is true, that God had giuen it him euen before he came into it, &amp; had rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13060:119"/>the ſame benefite many time. For ſo it is, that it was ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thy ſeede for foure hundredth yeares ſhall be a ſtranger in another land.</hi> And therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt put this doctrine continually in practize: to wit, to be quiet &amp; at reſt, notwithſtanding that he be there as a ſtranger by way of borowing leaue, &amp; muſt always haue one foote lifted vp to be going. To be ſhort, he muſt be like a birde on a bough, as we ſay. Thus we ſee why he did homage vnto the king of <hi>Gerar.</hi> For he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook not the grant which God had made him: but becauſe the time was not yet come for him (to enioy it, &amp; to take poſſeſsion therof: he was therefore contented to liue there as a ſtranger.<note place="margin">Gen. 23.9.</note> And we ſhall ſee alſo hereafter why he would buy a burying place for his wife: It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not as yet the owner of one foote of ground, &amp; yet by faith he receiued that which was giuen him. Thus wee ſee that his hope extended it ſelf farther than this preſent life. And yet notwithſtanding wee ſee that it is not without cauſe ſaid, which is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the <hi>119 Pſalme: That God is a pauillion from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to all ſuch as trust in him.</hi> Fox <hi>Abraham</hi> was thruſt out vnto winde &amp; raine, &amp; to all ſtormes, when as he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a barbarous &amp; verie cruell people; &amp; yet God ouerſhadowed him: but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he rather liked to leaue the earth, and to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13060:119"/>lift his heart vp to heauen, than to beat his head about the getting of lands &amp; poſſeſsions. He therefore ſo paſſed ouer this world, as that he neuer ſet his minde vpon it. And ſo God in the ende ſhewed the effect &amp; performance of this promiſe; not but that he had ſeen ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thereof whileſt he liued. But his hope, as we haue already ſaid, ſtretched it ſelf a great deale farther: and ſo conſequently we may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>That he builded not his neaſt here in this world: neither was it the marke wher at he aymed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.13.</note> For he might haue returned vnto the countrey from whence he came, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the countrey wheras he was borne; to wit, into <hi>Chaldea:</hi> but he held himſelf there, where he had neither poſſeſsion, kinred, nor friends. Thus then we ſee that he looked higher than vnto the world.</p>
               <p>Now if this then was in him at thoſe daies when as the doctrine appeared nothing ſo cleare by farre, as at this day it doeth vnto vs. VVhat excuſe ſhall wee make, forſomuch as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath once appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and was conuerſant here in the world, and aſcended into heauen, and hath ſet open the gate for vs, and doth by his Goſpell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly ſolicite vs to aſpire vpward? If wee (I ſay) be continually wrapped and ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp in theſe corruptible things? muſt not this be a moſt villainous vnthankfulneſſe?</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:13060:120"/>
               <p>And therefore, let vs learne ſo to dwell in this world, as that wee may enioy and take pleaſure of the benefits which the Lorde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth here vpon vs: but yet in ſuch ſort, as to ſaye with Saint <hi>Paul: That our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 3.20.</note> and are alreadie citizens thereof, although it be as yet but in hope. And in deede, wee are alſo to remember what is ſaide in another place: <hi>That ſo long as wee dwell in theſe mortall bodies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>wee are as it were abſent from God.</hi> VVee ſee alſo that wee haue not the fruition of his preſence: <hi>Becauſe that our ſpirituall life is hid.</hi> For if it were not ſo,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.3.</note> wee ſhoulde effectually enioy it, and then ſhall faith ceaſe: For (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth) <hi>That which a man hopeth to haue is not ſeene.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.24</note> And therefore let vs learne, that ſith GOD draweth vs vnto him ſelfe, not to be ſo baſe minded as to drenche our ſelues here on earth ouer head and eares, as it were, in filthie myer and dyrt: but continually goe on, knowing that this is the very bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten path and high way for vs to aſpyre a great deale higher.</p>
               <p>Nowe, it is verie much that is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Lo here verie great and commendable vertues, as when GOD graunteth him reſt and peace, he doeth not ſecurely ſleepe therein: for although the king gaue him leaue to dwel patiently in his Tent,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13060:120"/>yet hee acknowledged himſelfe to bee but a ſtranger: and although euery man became his friend, and were ready to bee at vnitie with him; yet coulde hee in no wiſe keepe company with them, but had rather haue beene at vtter defiance with them, than he would at any hand haue conformed and framed himſelfe to their ſuperſtitions and idolatries, and ſtill helde his courſe in truly worſhipping of the liuing God. In all this (as I haue already ſaid) hee ſhewed very excellent vertues. But <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſacrifice which is farre greater, and much more exquiſite: that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> was inforced to kill his ſonne, yea euen his owne only ſonne. Nowe this was an Obedience vnto God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all meaſure ſurpaſſing any mans power to performe, although in very deede we ought to be his, both in life and death: But that which is here commaunded <hi>Abraham</hi> to doo, is farre beyond all the reſt. For the matter in queſtion is not onely of <hi>Abraham</hi> his full Obedience towards God, in forſaking himſelfe, and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſonne to bee taken from him which was giuen him, and ſo to bee quite and cleane rid of him when as it ſhould pleaſe God to take him from him, and to ſuffer all this patiently. This I ſay is not the queſtion, but the matter is, that hee muſt kill him with his owne handes. Now this is ſuch an hard and ſtrange thing, as that the very hearing of it once ſpoken off, is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13060:121"/>able to aſtoniſh and kill the very heart of any man. It is not then without cauſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> from the nineteenth Chapter after he had her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſpoken of the life of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſetteth downe this Acte,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.1.</note> and ſaith that after theſe thinges God againe tempted him. Now it was a very great temptation when as God tooke him from his fathers houſe: for ſo the wordes import, when he ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Get thee out of thy fathers houſe, and from all thy kinsfolkes, and from the place where thou wert borne,</hi> and I pray you where could hee finde a better place to dwell in?</p>
               <p>This is the Countrie which I meane to bring thee vnto, a Country forſooth which he neuer knewe: and therefore he muſt be there like a feather caſt into the wind, not knowing which way to winde himſelfe. This I ſay was a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temptation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as he muſt needs go whither God called him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither, and yet neuertheles this was as it were his <hi>a b c.</hi> Thus we ſee how God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when as he meneth to teach in his ſchool. And hee was no ſooner come into the lande, but that hee was eftſoones driuen out thereof as it were with famine, and his wife alſo taken from him. And the next time alſo, we ſee that hee was vexed in euery place and could haue no reſt any where, for there was not any one within all the Country which did not ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13060:121"/>againſt him, and yet he patiently endured and ſuffered all theſe thinges. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee did not once mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although <hi>Abraham</hi> was this roughly hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed, yet conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he the courſe hee began: But how long ſuffered he all theſe tryals? hee was not onely thus dealt withall three or fower yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but was ſo tumbled and toſſed as that vvhen he had paſſed tvventy thirty, and forty years in that Land, he was to beginne againe to abide vvorſe ſtormes than hee had at any time before bidden; as to bee inforced to forſake the loue of his eldeſt ſonne, and to bee vtterly ſpoiled of him, vvhich vvas to him more griefe and ſorrovv than a very kinde of death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>After hee had ſuſtained theſe great and moſt grieuous temptations, that GOD had promiſed to giue him the Land, yet vvas hee ſo baited, as if hee had not beene vvorthy once to haue ſet his foote in any place of the Land.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:13060:122"/>
               <p>God had alſo promiſed him ſeede,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.3.</note> but that came not neither vntill ſuch time as hee was foure ſcore yeares olde, and his wife barren, ſo as it ſeemed vnto them, that this promiſe was but a very mockerie. And when hee was an hundred yeares olde he had <hi>Iſaak.</hi> But <hi>Iſmael</hi> muſt be thruſt out of the dores, and bee bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as heretofore we haue heard. If we could well ſauour and taſt theſe temptations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt we ſhould be wonderfully amazed to ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> haue ſuch a powerfull and conſtant faith, to fight againſt ſuch aſſaults and to ouercome them. Now then, when it is ſaide, <hi>After theſe things:</hi> it is to ſhew that God mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſet before vs in the perſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuch a ſpectacle, as that whenſoeuer wee ſhall come to the fight, it ſhall not bee hurtfull vnto vs to followe his ſteppes, neither yet thinke it ſtrange or any newe thing to conforme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion our ſelues like vnto him who is father of the whole Church. But yet this is moſt certain that although euery man woulde throughly looke vnto the temptations which he is to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet ſhall he not be able to ſee the hundreth part of that which wee ſee in <hi>Abraham.</hi> And therefore this is to bee noted; that as God had bountifully beſtowed the giftes and graces of his holy ſpirite vpon him, ſo alſo meant hee to make a through tryall of his faith: for God will not haue his gifts lie a ruſting and bee vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13060:122"/>in vs; But will deale with euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that meaſure of his graces which he hath vouchſafed vs. For hee prepareth vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them, or els vve vvere neuer able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe them: nor once moue one finger to doo vvel, except the Lord doth ſo diſpoſe the ſame and giueth vs the power to doo it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenſoeuer he putteth vs to the Combat, he beſtoweth the graces of his holy ſpirite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. Now forſomuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> had great perfection in compariſon of vs, according as wee are men, ſee how God alſo prooued him with ſuch ſtrange ſorts of tryalls as wee are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to come nere vnto. Howbeit ſo much the leſſe excuſe haue wee for our idlenes, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and wantonnes, if we follow not at leaſt in ſome meaſure our father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the conſtancy of our faith be not equal vnto his, yet if wee indeuour not our ſelues to follow him ſome what aloofe (as we ſay) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our abilitie and infirmitie, without doubt we ſhall be without all excuſe. So then wee haue from hence to gather: That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was all his life long tormented both in ſoule and bodie: and yet when it was come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vpcaſt (as we ſay) God would needs prooue him without all compariſon more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than euer at any time before he had done, ſo that it had beene able to haue madehim a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand times to haue diſpaired, had he

               <p>The bookes are not as yet open: but yet ſo as that God knoweth and iudgeth that which he will make manifeſt at the laſt day. And therefore hee hath no neede to ſounde and try vs,<note place="margin">Afflictions are the gifts of God, and trials of out faith.</note> for he doth that, that is in vs: But this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the probation of our faith. For as we haue alredy ſaid, God will not haue his gifts to be vnprofitable, but will apply them to ſome vſe, to the end he may therby be glorified: and we thereby alſo ſo much the better be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, conſidering how wonderfully hee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs: and would haue vs with patience fight againſt all the aſſalts of Sathan &amp; of the world: that wee thereby might finde by experience, that God is with vs, and loueth vs; Wherefore wee haue good cauſe the more confidently to call vpon him, to runne vnto him, and ſtay our ſelues vppon his goodnes, and not to doubt of his helpe euen vnto the end.<note place="margin">God tryeth vs by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, both for his ovvne glorie and alſo for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Thus we ſee then in ſumme why God tryeth vs, to wit, that hee will haue the gifts which hee beſtovveth on vs to be applyed to ſerue him: to the end all men might knovv his povver, goodnes, and vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: that therby he might be glorified as he deſerueth: But it is chiefly to this end, that vve might knovv his fatherly goodnes tovvards vs, and be ſo much the more ſtirred vp to honour him, and fully and vvholly dedicate our ſelues vnto him: and vvithall to truſt altogether in him.

No, no, it muſt not be ſo; and therfore it is meete that it ſhould be tryed. VVherefore, let not vs thinke it ſtrange, that if the Lorde ſhoulde ſo deale with vs, as to loſe the raynes to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to lead vs to do euill: to haue the wicked alſo vexe and torment vs: and beſides, to haue other inward temptations laide vpon vs. To be ſhort, if wee ſhould be exerciſed euery ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way;<note place="margin">Note.</note> yet let vs know that we had need to haue the Lorde for his parte to ſet downe vnto vs that which before was hidden, and to vs vnknowen.

But for this time it ſhall ſuffice that wee giue you a little taſte thereof. For, the queſtion is not, that the beſt beloued and onely childe of a father muſt be put to death, and to dye a violent death before the fathers owne eyes, and with the fathers owne handes: This is not all and the chiefe matter: but the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is; which way that ſaluation ſhould come that <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for by his dead ſonne <hi>Iſank,</hi> according to the Lordes promiſe. For, for men to kill their children is nothing in compariſon of this. For, there is no man that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13060:125"/>will acknowledge his childe to be his ſauiour. But although <hi>Iſaak</hi> was not <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: yet he knewe that the ſauiour of the world ſhould come of him. From whence then is it, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to looke for his righteouſnes, welfare, and ſaluation, without it werein the perſon of <hi>Iſaak,</hi> that is to ſay, in him which ſhould proceed from him? Is <hi>Iſaak</hi> then dead? VVhy, then is all the worlde vtterly loſt and damned, and the diuell raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ruling euery where. Beholde then God an enimie to all mankinde and to all the creatures: and there remaineth now nothing elſe, but the wrath and vengeance of God enflamed and ſet on fire to deuoure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all: for this ſonne of his, <hi>Iſaak,</hi> muſt be killed by <hi>Abraham</hi> his owne hande: yea, euen by <hi>Abraham,</hi> who receiued this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from God his owne mouth, as thus: <hi>I will giue thee a ſonne, who ſhall be ſo bleſſed, as that all men ſhall be ſaued through the grace which I ſhall bestowe vpon him:</hi> and yet muſt this ſonne be put to death?</p>
               <p>Here then wee ſee (as I haue alreadie ſaid) Hell ſtanding wide open, and the diuel ſo ruling, as that all is quite and cleane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: For there is no more looking for the promiſes of ſaluation, ſeeing that hee that ſhould giue life to all creatures, is himſelfe put to death.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:13060:126"/>
               <p>Now, whither then muſt wee goe? The queſtion then is not here, according to mans iudgement, to wound the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi> with afflictions and ſorrowes onely? but the queſtion is to kill his verie faith, and all the hope conceiued of his owne ſaluation. It ſhould ſeem that God meant to tread vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote whatſoeuer hope of his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he had promiſed him. To be ſhort, it ſhould ſeeme that he did but mocke <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide: Goe thy way; thou art but a beaſt to waite and follow mee, and to take ſuch paine to obey mee. I promiſed thee a Trybe, from which the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the whole worlde ſhould come: and I haue performed my promiſe in giuing thee thy ſonne <hi>Iſaak:</hi> But thou muſt by and by go and cut his throat, thereby to let thee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thou art but a ſimple and fooliſh fellow, to truſt vnto that which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee; and to thinke to haue a Trybe, &amp; ſuch a precious Trybe alſo as ſhould be more worth than all the whole world beſides: yea, than an hundreth thouſand worldes.

Heere wee ſee that God gaue the childe the name: and what was that? <hi>Laughter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioye,</hi> Nowe it ſhould ſeeme that all this was but in mockerie, as if he would haue ſaide: This is verie well for thee; for here is nothing but ioyfulnes.

But there will come, ere it belong, ſuch a quame ouer thy ſtomach as will pearſe thee at the verie heart: For thou thy ſelfe muſt be the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to this childe whome thou ſo dearely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt: and muſt drawe out thy knife, and lift vp thine hande to cut his throat, Muſt not <hi>Abraham</hi> (nowe thinke you) be thought to be a very hangman; and by this meanes ſtirre vp all his neighbours about him in a rage: to ſay, what a villaine is this, that is gone out to kill his owne ſonne? Beholde a mad man; a man poſſeſt with a diuell; muſt not this be a verie diueliſh furie?</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee him confounded, as it were, before God, and abhorred of the worlde. But yet this is not all: for hee ſaith, <hi>Take thy
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13060:127"/>ſonne;</hi> and what ſhall I doe with him? <hi>Take him, I ſaie, and ſacrifice him.</hi> And wither ſhall I lead him? <hi>Carrie him vnto ſuch a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine As I ſhall name vnto thee.</hi> Nowe, muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> needes be verie ſore vexed and grieued: and beſides; muſt hee needes kill his onely ſonne? Muſt hee needes alſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſuch a long and tedious iourney with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any guide he coulde not tell whether? And muſt God likewiſe holde his noſe not onely to the grind-ſtone; but alſo ſo racke and torment him, as it is impoſsible for any tongue to ſpeake, or heart to imagine? Are not theſe ſuch thinges as farre ſurpaſſeth all mans reaſon, and (as it were impoſsible) to ſuffer and abide?</p>
               <p>For, as it was before ſaide vnto him, when he departed from the place where he was; that hee knewe not whither GOD woulde lead him: euen ſo is it here; for there is no place at this time aſsigned him, otherwiſe than thus: <hi>Thou ſhalt goe from hence into the lande of Moria.</hi> Hee muſt needes goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, from the place where hee had liued the moſte parte of his aged yeares; yea, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee was verie olde, as wee haue alreadie heard: <hi>Goe thy waye</hi> (ſayeth hee) and when thou art there, then will I ſhewe thee where thou ſhalt ſacrifice thy ſonne.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:13060:128"/>
               <p>Here then wee ſee, how many waies the Lord ſo ſounded the heart of his ſeruaunt, as that all the temptations which wee were able to pyle vp togither would neuer be like: and if wee ſhould compare them with thoſe that ſhould be laide vpon vs to abide, they would ſeeme nothing in reſpect of that which wee here ſee. And therfore we ſee that God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſpareth our weaknes, in not bringing vs thus farre. For if any of vs ſhould be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any ſicknes that ſhould laſt long, wee would ſo ſorrow and grieue, as that we would be verie angrie with God.</p>
               <p>Againe, if any man ſhould dye, his wife would growe ſo melancholie, as that ſhee would be altogether impatient and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. If God ſhould take away any of our children: yea, although wee had many, wee would be angrie with our ſelues, and weepe and mourne extremely: and therefore, what would we do if we ſhould be brought to this paſſe, as here it is ſaid, euen to kill with our owne hands our owne children, and not leaue one aliue, but diſpatch our houſe of them all? yet would not all this be any whit compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> his triall. For, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which God beſtoweth vpon vs now at this day, are not the ground worke of our ſaluation: Neither ought wee to leaue the hauing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, although all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13060:128"/>humaine knowledge ſhould periſh and decay: VVherefore let vs acknowledge that God ſupporteth vs, and pittieth our weaknes when as hee bringeth not vs vnto ſo hard a tryall, as this which <hi>Moſes</hi> heere maketh mention of. Let this then be a good aduertiſement vnto vs that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſhal proue vs, that we yeeld our necks to the yoke, &amp; ſuffer him to make tryall of vs. And this is the moſt principall point of all our life, ſo to yeeld our ſelues as that God may diſpoſe of vs as pleaſeth him: and not grudgingly reply and ſay, that he dealeth thus and thus hardly with vs. This (I ſay) is the chiefeſt point of our whole life. In very deede (I muſt needes ſay) that this were a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent great good gift in vs, as to bee able to walke in integrity of life amongſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to doo no man wrong, to liue chaſtly, and ſoberly all the daies of our life, eſchewing all drunkennes, intemperancie, blaſphemie, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>VVell ſyr, I muſt needes in truth ſay, that theſe are great vertues, but yet they are not alwaies found in vs; and yet for all that, this is not the chiefeſt point. For the principalleſt point, (as I haue already ſaid) is this, that when we ſerue God, although many ſorrowes and griefes torment vs, although the Diuell ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs alarmes, and lyeth in ambuſh for vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men growe ſo peruerſe and wicked, as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13060:129"/>that one ſpurreth vs heere; another ſtriketh vs there, and another ſeeketh our vtter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And on the other ſide, although wee hang our wings (as we ſay,) although wee be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbit, and altogether blamed &amp; contemned, although all theſe things fall out for our ſhares and portion, yet muſt wee ſo bleſſe the name of God, as that we muſt mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now when as wee ſhall growe vnto this patience, that (no doubt) is the moſt principall marke that wee muſt ſhoote at. And aboue all things, this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie ought a great deale the move bee reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and meditated of vs, conſidering that the Lord would ſhew that vnto vs which wee are to comprehend from our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the ende wee might follow his example. And when as God, (as I haue already ſaide) ſhall haue thus framed vs, and brought vs to this paſſe, let vs dedicate our ſelues and all that we haue vnto his Maieſtie. For it <hi>Abraham</hi> had not had this grounde and principle, without doubt he had neuer ſtept one foote forwarde, but had rather fled away from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than haue come neare him: howbeit hee had not this principle as from himſelfe, but becauſe it was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13060:129"/>the gift of God, hee was not therefore to vſe it and keepe it backe as it pleaſed him: But muſt make a reckoning of it to him that gaue it him, ſaying, <hi>Here am I,</hi> as after warde hee ſhewed it. For when God called him and ſaid, <hi>Abraham: Here am I Lord,</hi> (quoth hee) This anſwere ſhewed that <hi>Abraham</hi> was as it were ready at hand to receiue the commandements which God would giue him, euen as a diligent ſeruant ſhould doo. For if his Maiſter goeth forth, he is by and by at his heeles, to ſay, will it pleaſe you to haue any thing with mee? And if his Maiſter tarrieth within dores, hee will ſettle himſelfe to harken what his Maiſter wil command him; as to bid him doo this, or goe to ſuch a place. So then <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewed that he ſerued not himſelf nor his owne affections, but ſo dedicated himſelfe vnto God, as that whatſoeuer hee had was his alſo. Neither did hee this hypocritically, as a great many of men may ſay vnto God with their mouthes, <hi>Here am I:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding befarre inough from him. But when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaide, <hi>Here am I,</hi> he proteſted thereby that hee was euen before God: for afterward, he proteſted, that his feete, handes, eies, eares, all his ſenſes, and all the partes both of his bodie and ſoule were ready to ſerue God, and to put his necke vnder his yoke, and to goe whither ſoeuer hee would haue him.</p>

               <p>WE haue heard that this was the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and hardeſt conflict that euer <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuſtained in all the daies of his life,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13060:131"/>the going with his ſonne <hi>Iſaak</hi> into a mountain and there to offer him for a burnt offring: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the firſt place he was to kill him with his owne hands. Now it hath beene ſhewed vs here before, that God would declare vnto vs in our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that we muſt ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all our naturall affections, as that his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bee preferred aboue all the reſt.

               <p>Now it might ſtand at the firſt ſight, that that which he did, had no good found founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true and liuely faith, becauſe faith hath reſpect to the promiſſes. And yet (as I haue already ſaide) <hi>Abraham</hi> could looke for nothing but by <hi>Iſaak</hi> his meanes: Becauſe it is ſaide, <hi>That in Chriſt Ieſus all the promiſes of God are moſt ſure,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 120</note> and yea, and Amen.</hi> For our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt muſt come of the ſtocke of <hi>Iſaak,</hi> and that was in very deede the ſeede which was promiſed him. How then coulde <hi>Abraham</hi> bee contented to haue his ſonne to die, and yet to haue the promiſes of God to ſtand in full ſtrength power and vertue? Now the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That by faith, Abraham of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred his ſonne Iſaacke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.17.</note> So that by this wee are let to vnderſtand that <hi>Abraham</hi> (fall out as it would) reſted wholly vpon the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God: and as for the contrarietie which may ſeeme to bee betweene the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the promiſe: The Apoſtle anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.19 Gen. 21.12</note> 
                  <hi>That hee beleeued that God was as able to raiſe ſeede out of the aſhes of Iſaak, as he was able to performe his former promiſes.</hi> Now this is a profitable point for vs, if wee vnderſtand it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: For wee are heereby admoniſhed ſo to beleeue in God, as that we looke further than vnto the world, and whatſoeuer els wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perceiue and comprehend by our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon and vnderſtanding. For if faith ſtaid
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13060:132"/>it ſelf vpon that which we ſee, it Were nothing. And then were the power of God maruelouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſhed. Moreouer, wee are to conſider of the wordes of the Apoſtle, ſaying in this manner, <hi>Faith is the ground of things hoped for,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and the euidence of things not ſeene:</hi> Agreeing with the words of the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the Romains, ſaying, <hi>We hope not for the things which we ſee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> 
                  <hi>but for the things we ſee not:</hi> yea, euen for thinges that ſeeme to bee impoſſible. Sith then it is ſo that the promiſes of God doo not ſet before our eies that which is contained in them: we muſt (as I haue already ſaid) when we ſpeake of faith looke further than vnto the world. And how is that? To wit, wee muſt not meaſure the infinite power of God with the meanes which are ſet before vs, and as wee comprehend them. But when as we ſhall haue theſe toyes in our heads, as to thinke that this or that can neuer come to paſſe, and that there ſeeme to bee a very contradiction in the caſe, yet let vs thus conclude, without all doubt God will performe whatſoeuer hee hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>But wee will ſay, howe can it poſſibly bee? Oh let not vs iudge of it, wee muſt here bring vnder our owne ſenſes and wits, and doo God this honour, to ſay, that he is faithful: But wee knowe not what will bee the iſſue thereof, or elſe thinke that all is ſhut vp and cloſed.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:13060:133"/>
               <p>Here then we ſee what we are to learne out of theſe words of the Apoſtle. Now if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had reaſoned like naturall man, he might haue ſaid, that God was not contrary vnto him ſelfe: For he told me that I ſhould haue ſeede by <hi>Iſaak,</hi> and that from thence, the Sauiour of the world ſhould come: and I muſt not forget this. And yet at this preſent he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to kill <hi>Iſaak;</hi> Here is no order in this, for I will take him at his firſt worde, and that muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi> might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner haue excuſed himſelfe, and yet haue beene a Rebell vnto God vnder the colour of obedience. But what doth hee? hee conſidered with himſelfe that God was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and therefore able to accompliſh whatſoeuer promiſe hee had made concerning <hi>Iſaak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay wel ſyr, but what if he had died, how then? And what of that? As though God were not Lord ouer death: Heere wee ſee the right conflict of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, which is, death is ſet before his eies which was inough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him; but he extolled the power of God farre beyond all this and ſaid, yet will GOD ouercome and bee a mightie Conquerour herein.</p>
               <p>And howe can that bee? Oh this is not a matter for any man to iudge or determine of,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13060:133"/>nor to giue ſcope to his opinion to meaſure the power of GOD, but hoodwinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſay thus: God will ſo bring this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to paſſe, as that I ſhall be aſtoniſhed to ſee it. But it is not for me to aske how and which way he will doo it: for I muſt keepe me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compaſſe, vntill ſuch time as God ſheweth me that, which I before knew not. And this may the more clearely appeare, by the anſwer of <hi>Abraham</hi> vnto his ſonne, when hee ſaith, <hi>My Sonne, GOD will prouide one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Novv then vvhen ſee hovv vvee are to honour God, that is, vvhen as vvee ſpeake of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his promiſes, vve hold vs to them, and reſolue to go vvhitherſoeuer he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs: To vvite, let vs knovv, <hi>That the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of death are in his hande,</hi> as in the three ſcore and eight <hi>Pſalme</hi> it is ſaide: and although vve ſee nothing elſe but bottomles depths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, making ſhevv to ſvvallovv vs quite and cleane vp: yet let vs goe on vvhither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer GOD calleth vs. Novv it is namely ſaid, <hi>That Abraham ſadled his Aſſe, and laid the wood vpon him with the reſt of the prouiſion, and went on with two of his Seruaunts and his Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere <hi>Moſes</hi> more eſpecially expreſſeth that, vvhich hath beene heeretofore touched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To vvite, that God tryed the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the full, in holding him in ſuſpence.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:13060:134"/>
               <p>It was ſufficient, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had but cut the wood, and had gone but an arrowe ſhot one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue killed his ſonne: But he muſt take a good long iourney in hand, hee could not tell whither, nor yet how faire; and withall, night alſo approcheth, which alwaies brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it more ſorrowe, griefe and care: for whenſoeuer any man is full of penſiuenes and care, no doubt of it, his paine and griefe is farre more intollerable in the night than in the day: and yet muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> abide al this, and be vexed euery way. VVell Syr, hee riſeth againe next morning betimes, and then beginneth his griefe afreſh. All that day hee beholdeth his ſonne, whome he muſt after a ſhort while kill: and beſides, theſe fantaſies are ſtill tumbling in his minde. VVhat? muſt I murder mine owne fleſh and bloud? and muſt I commit the moſt deteſtable act that is poſsibly to be imagined, both before God and men? VVhy? this is ſuch a monſtrous piece of woork, as is able to make the haires of all the whole world ſtand vpright? And yet (notwithſtanding) fall out as it will, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> muſt be driuen ſtill to do it, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſecond night vntill the third day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch time as God ſhewed him the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Moria,</hi> which is the place whereon <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was afterward built.</p>
               <p>Here then wee ſee what wee are hereby to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13060:134"/>learne: to wit, that if wee vvill ſtoutly fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations, vve muſt not haue a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine kind of heate of faith onely: But ſuch a perſeuerance therein as that vve neuer giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, although God continueth vs ſtill in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and fights, and deliuereth vs not out of them at the firſt incounter. And this is a very neceſſarie point for vs to conſider of, for you ſhall haue many men ſhevv great and ſingular affection in their obedience tovvardes God, and yet many times it will ſhevv it ſelfe to be but like a puffe of vvinde vvhich ſoone vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth avvay, as vvee haue ſeene too too much experience thereof. VVherefore let vs not thinke it ſtrange if God deliuereth not vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent vvhen as vvee ſhall bee aſſailed to fight, and to haue our faith proued, albeit vve conquer not the firſt day: But vve muſt fight continually and not thinke that God paſſeth meaſure, but rather let vs chooſe to follovv the example of our father <hi>Abraham</hi> in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>Novv it is ſoone after ſaid, <hi>That he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his ſeruants to abide there, and laid the wood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſonne Iſahak which was for the ſacrifice.</hi> For the queſtion vvas not onely to kill <hi>Iſahak,</hi> but to burne him alſo to aſhes: VVherefore he laid the vvood vpon <hi>Iſahak,</hi> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſeruants to abide there: For hee right vvell knevve that his ſeruaunts vvould neuer
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13060:135"/>haue ſuffered him to commit ſuch an Acte, But vvould rather haue thought thus vvith themſelues: Did you euer ſee ſuch a doting olde man? Surely he is mad, he ſaith that God commaunded him ſo to doo: But is it poſſible that GOD vvould commaund ſuch a cruell thing to be done? And therefore they vvould neuer haue imagined this obedience to be any part of the ſeruice of God; but vvould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue taken it to bee the part of a ſurious and mad man.</p>
               <p>Novv <hi>Abraham</hi> knevv this vvell inough, and this is a circumſtance vvhich vvee are to note, to vvite, that ſeeing he vnderſtoode the infamie and reproch that vvould light vppon him, and that euery man vvould thinke it vvas done rather like a franticke man, than a ſeruice vvhich could any vvay pleaſe GOD: ſith, (I ſay) he vnderſtoode this, and yet cared not hovv ignominiouſly men vvould iudge of him in committing a fault cleane againſt nature, and ſuch an enormious and deteſtable cruelty as could not bee a greater, and yet vvould not deſiſt from the purſuing thereof: Let vs learne after his example, that although all the vvorld ſhould find fault vvith vs, and ſpit in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and be condemned, vvhere vve ſhould be commended for our true ſeruing of God, yet let not vs at any hande ceaſe to obay and doo whatſoeuer hee commaundeth. For, if this
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13060:135"/>conſtancie be not in vs, vvithout doubt, vvee ſerue our ovvne ambition; and ſo ſhall haue our revvard as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: That vvhen vve ſhal looke after the praiſes of men, in ſaying that all that vvee doe is vvell done, and vve vvell pleaſed to bee here ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Let vs looke to haue no part in heauen, becauſe vvee haue had ouermuch regard vnto the vvorld. But if vve ſhal haue this patience in vs; as that although men turne vnto the vvorſt vvhatſoeuer vve doo in the obeying of God, and yet vvee goe on that good courſe vvhich we began vvithout pulling our heads out of the choller; Then ſhall vve be ſure to find our revvard in heauen. Thus vve ſee hovv vvee ſhould ſhevv our ſelues in truth, that it is God vnto vvhom vvee goe about to approue our ſelues.</p>
               <p>To bee ſhort, if vvee ſet not at naught all the iudgements of men, and patiently beare all the opprobries, ignomies, and blames that can poſſibly be laid vpon vs, it is moſt ſure that our faith doth not ſhew it ſelfe ſuch as it ought to be. VVee ſee alſo vvhy ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs by his example, to vvalke through ſhame and infamie, in ſteede of good report: and for vvell dooing, to bee euill ſpoken of: that is to ſay, vvhen as vvee ſhall haue had a iuſt and good meaning, and that vvee ſhall haue God for vvitnes that vve haue deſired to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:13060:136"/>conforme and frame our ſelues to doo his vvil: and yet men charge vs and lay falſe crimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Let vs conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and approueth vs. Novv vve had as great neede of this doctrine at this day as euer vvee had: For generally, if vvee make profeſſion of Chriſtianity: VVee muſt looke to bee eſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as heretiques, and dogs: and to haue the vvorld iudge vs to ſeeke nothing els but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations and troubles: and to bee very Rebels: and that vvee haue forſaken God: and to bee ſhort, that vvee are farre vvorſe than Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtataes.</p>
               <p>Thus vve ſee hovv the Papiſts ſpeake daily of vs. Novv if vvee be ſo effeminate, and haue ſuch itching eares, as vve ſee a great many that vvould faine keepe themſelues in their good reputation; vvithout doubt vve ſhall cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly davvbe and ſmooth ouer euery thing, and ſo in the end forſake God. VVherefore vvee are ſo much the rather rightly to meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this doctrine. To vvit, vvee muſt not care vvhat reputation vve haue vvith men, ſo that vve be approued before God. VVe may alſo come to particulars, as if any man ſhall vvalke in the ſimplicitie of his heart godly and honeſtly, yee ſhall haue ſome fall a ſcoffing at him, yee ſhall haue other ſome call him hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and another ſort vvill ſay, that he doth it for gaine.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:13060:136"/>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the Diuell by theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle practiſes goeth about to make vs become diſſolute. VVherefore we are to learne, ſo to apply all our ſenſes vnto God, as that although men neuer ſo vniuſtly blame vs, yet let not vs be mooued once to bend or yeeld, but haue an eie alwaies vnto the way that is ſet before vs. VVe ſee alſo what collection we are to make heereof, what a ſtrong faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had when he was thus qualified, for hee premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated theſe things, as if he had been at his eaſe: For if we be any whit paſſioned, &amp; then haue a purpoſe to doo good, yet ſhall our mindes many times be carryed away, and ſhal become ſo blockiſh, as that wee cannot tell at which end to beginne, nor what order to take. VVe ſee it in thoſe that are of the greateſt magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, that when they are perplexed, they wil not goe ſo directly to a matter as otherwiſe they could. Now <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt needs haue a troubled minde amongſt all the fantaſies which were in his head, as to thinke, ſurely my Seruants will keepe me from dooing this Act, becauſe they will thinke me to be mad: and in ſteede of binding my ſonne, they will bind me and carry mee backe in ſpite of my teeth into ſome houſe, and there keepe me like a mad and ſauáge beaſt, as if God had vtterly condemned me. Now <hi>Abraham</hi> foreſaw all theſe thinges. Hereby wee may iudge, that in the middeſt of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13060:137"/>theſe darkneſſes he was ſo enlightened by the ſpirite of God, as that he had alwaies counſell &amp; diſcretion accordingly as he had need ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. VVe are therefore by his example let to vnderſtand, that when wee haue ſuch great paſsions as may aſtoniſh vs, ſo as wee knowe not which way to turne vs; Let vs beſeech the Lord to direct vs. And although our natural ſenſes be confounded: yet that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the faith which wee haue may ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as that wee may knowe which way to hold. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> hath here before recyted, that God ſent yet a farre more ſharpe torture vnto his ſeruant <hi>Abraham</hi> than to any of the reſt. For as he was going on the way with his ſonne <hi>Iſaak,</hi> he ſaid vnto his father, <hi>My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> wee muſt not thinke that this ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13060:137"/>that hardly ſhal we be able to abide the hundreth part of that he abode, &amp; yet he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame it. Then <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Here am I my ſonne.</hi> And ſoone after <hi>Iſaak</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Loe, here is wood &amp; fire, we are going to do ſacrifice;</hi> &amp; to what purpoſe? for <hi>here is neuer a beaſt to offer in ſacrifice? Iſaak</hi> right wel knew that they went to offer a burnt offring vnto God; but he knew not what it was that ſhould be offred, &amp; therefore he asked. Was it poſsible for <hi>Abraham</hi> to be thus racked, &amp; be able to beare it? Yea forſooth: for God would not abate him an inch of it, becauſe we might learn to haue ſo much the greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Thus we ſee what we haue here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. True it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> recyteth this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply &amp; plainly. Now, if we ſhould read theſe things without thinking why they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: without doubt we ſhuld haue but a cold pul of it: neither ſhould we be greatly moued with it. But when as we ſhal haue throughly conſidered, in what eſtate <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and how mightily his heart was diſtreſſed, &amp; ther vpon ſhall come to iudge when this ſtrange temptation was put vpon him: and into what anguiſh he might be driuen, when as his ſonne ſaid vnto him, <hi>My father:</hi> Firſt, to ſee <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> marke the ſimplicitie of his ſonne; &amp; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to think with him ſelfe, Alas poore boye, thou knoweſt not for what purpoſe thou art prepared.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:13060:138"/>
               <p>As for example: If a poore man ſhould be led to his death, not knowing any thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; although he were nothing to vs, and wee not preſent when as he ſhould be thus dealt withall, but did only thinke vpon it, and ſaye in our ſelues: what a ſtraunge thing is this, to heare of a poore man ledd to the ſhambles as a lambe to be ſlaine, no whit doubting of any ſuch thing. Surely, the verie thinking of it would make vs ſhed teares.</p>
               <p>Now, behold <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſeeth his owne ſonne, and beſides, he ſeeth him as a lambe lead by himſelfe to the ſhambles, and him ſelfe alſo to be the man that muſt cut his throat, and afterward burne him to aſhes: and to heare his ſoone which was with him ſpeake ſo ſimply, <hi>Where is the beaſt for the burnt offering?</hi> To be ſhort; wee ſee, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God at this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y ſhould ſend vs all the afflictions that could be deuiſed, yet ſhoulde they be nothing in reſpect of that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here did beare. And if wee woulde alledge our infirmities, and ſaye, that our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine paſsions would ſo carrie vs away, as that wee ſhould neuer be able to do it. Why? Let vs thinke that <hi>Abraham</hi> was no more made either of Iron or Steele than wee are. But fall out as it would, he was fully reſolued to giue the whole maſtrie &amp; ſuperioritie vnto God, and ſo ſubiect himſelfe, as to renounce
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13060:138"/>and forſake him ſelfe. Thus wee ſee whither we muſt bend our ſelues to come, although we haue many lets by the way: and although wee thinke wee are not able to march one foote forwarde; yet muſt wee enforce our ſelues beyond all force. For the queſtion is not here; that wee ſhould go vnto it as in our owne ſtrength, as though we were verie able people of our ſelues: But we muſt attend &amp; looke to haue God to furniſh vs with that which is impoſsible for vs to doe, and farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue our power and abilitie. This then is it which we are here to retaine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs not doubt, that although there come neuer ſo manie things thwarting vs. but that it is God that hath to do in it: and not thinke any thing to come by Fortune, when as we are vexed this way, and aſſayled that way; but let vs thinke that God guideth and gouerneth all: and that he doth it, to the end we might learne the better to obey him, and not to haue our head and armes onely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but all the whole bodie: and to be ſo furniſhed as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo exhorteth vs, as that wee may be armed to be able to fight ſtoutly: for there he biddeth vs <hi>Take the ſword, the ſhield, and Helmet,</hi> and all the whole fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, euen from top to toe. And beſides he biddeth vs to put on the whole complete ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God. And why doth he ſo? becauſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13060:139"/>although we thinke our ſelues to be well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in one place, yet wil the diuel by his craft &amp; ſubtiltie, finde the meane td aſſaile in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and continually lye in ambuſh for vs. Thus wee ſee then, that wee muſt learne wiſely ſo to furniſh our ſelues, as that the diuel ſhal not be able to finde any breach about vs, neither yet finde any open place to enter into vs; but that we ſhall be able to repulſe both on the right and on the left ſide. And the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which <hi>Abraham</hi> maketh vnto his ſonne ſheweth the ſame a great deale better when as he ſayeth, <hi>My ſonne, God will prouide a Sacrifice.</hi> In theſe words we ſee that which hath heretofore been declared; to wite, that our faith muſt looke further than vnto this worlde. Neither can wee beleeue in God, without we giue place vnto his prouidence to rule ouer all thinges whatſoeuer that wee are able to iudge of or apprehend. And in verie deede, wee ſhould verie well encline our ſelues thereunto, if wee did conſider euen of thoſe workes of God which wee ſee before our eyes. If wee doe thinke of the courſe of nature, wee ſhall ſee the clowdes paſſe to &amp; fro, and yet wee knowe not what God will doe with them. VVee ſee how the raine falleth: we ſee alſo a whirle-winde ariſe with great and ſudden raine. VVee ſee likewiſe the heauen in ſhort time waxe darke: and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13060:139"/>where before it was faire and cleare, there is nowe nothing elſe but obſcuritie ouer all. All theſe things wee ſee, and wee ſhall haue Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſet vs downe naturall cauſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet without all doubt wee ſhall bee confounded of theſe things. Nowe, what if God ſhould preſently deale after a ſtraunge manner, not keeping his common and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed order? This then ſhould be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to be wonderfully aſtoniſhed when as wee ſpeake of the incomprehenſible power of God. And ſo wee ſhould frame our ſelues to acknowledge his prouidence, and worſhip him when as he declareth vnto vs that he will ſurmount all our reaſon and vnderſtanding. But what? It is great pitie that we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt God, and ſaye that he can do no more than all our ſenſes are able, at the firſt, to promiſe vs. And this is the reaſon why there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith in the worlde. And they alſo which are reaſonably well affected, and think them-ſelues diſpoſed to beleeue GOD; yet is their faith ſo leane and weake, as that a man ſhall not neede to haue any thing at all to rebate the edge thereof. Now, all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that commeth hereof is this, that wee are not perſuaded of the prouidence of God. VVhen Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That he gaue glorie vnto God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> becauſe he beleeued that he was almightie.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:13060:140"/>
               <p>And this is a part of that whereof he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: That we muſt referre all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer which may any way trouble vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whereof we can find no reaſon for it, vnto the prouidence of God. And therefore wee are a great deale the more to meditate vpon this doctrine. For whenſoeuer, and how often ſo euer there ſhall ariſe fantaſies in our heads to pull vs backe and coole vs, not to do that which God commaundeth vs, let this alwaies be our ſhield and defence: <hi>God will prouide;</hi> But as how? It ſeemeth many times that that which God commaundeth vs, bringeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with great inconueniences. And this is the curſed wiſedome of man that is the greateſt enimie vnto faith, and which hath alwayes borne the mightieſt ſway. For, wee ſee that God commaundeth Kings, Princes, &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to looke that he be honoured, &amp; his ſeruice purely &amp; ſincerely maintained. Now hereupon we ſhall haue men conſider thus &amp; thus with them ſelues, and ſaye, why? the world is now growne to be ſo wicked &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, as there is no dealing with it: and if we ſhould go on this courſe, all the world would rayle and crye out on vs. And beſides; if this ſtraight dealing ſhould be vſed, it will neuer come to good. For we ſee that it is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a matter to mannage and gouerne men: There will come troubles of it. And againe,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:13060:140"/>if they perceiue things ſomewhat hard to be brought to paſſe; then muſt there be ſome qualification, or elſe there will be no good done in it. Thus wee ſee (I ſay) with what temptations they ſhall be ſolicited which goe about to oppoſe them ſelues vnto any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. Nowe what commeth hereof in the ende? Surely, moſt commonly, that they which ſeeme to be moſt circumſpect &amp; wiſe, and thinke to ſee fartheſt into this geare; will ſo ſpeake and deale, as that they will prooue neither fiſh nor fleſh, as wee ſay: And ſo by this meanes, God is quite and cleane ſhut out of the dores. For, firſt this miſchief commeth of it; we obey him not ſoundly &amp; roundly as we ſhould: And beſides, we rob him of that honour that belongeth vnto him. For, if any man ſhall ſaye: O ſuch a matter may fall out if you ſo deale. VVhat? is God dead? Hath not he foreſeen for all the inconueniences that might come to paſſe? And if any man ſhal ſay; this geare muſt not goe on this ſort: for then ſuch a miſchiefe wil follow theron. Is not this to accuſe God of folly? &amp; to rob him of his power? as if he could not reſtraine any man from going whither he would? and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the iſſue therof to be both good &amp; proſperous? Euen ſo ſtandeth it with the miniſters of the word of God: for, there are a verie fewe of them that can diſcharge their
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:13060:141"/>dueties. True it is, that they haue many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which hinder them: but this curſed and diueliſh wiſedome raigneth in many, which will not ſticke to ſtirre vp ſundrie contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles, and thereupon be carried with euerie winde, where they may any way corrupt and falſifie the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, as at this day are manie ſuch. For howe are they bewitched, that will deale betweene Poperie &amp; Chriſtianitie, but that they think thus and thus with themſelues: O, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; to change and alter things after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were euen to make a newe world. O, we may not thus doe: for, if wee make ſuch an alteration as you ſpeake of? It is twentie to one, that all will come to naught. Thus wee fee how wee are contented to doe all thinges by halues, and ſwimme betweene two riuers. By this wee ſee how the doctrine of the word of God is corrupted: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as wee haue alreadie ſhewed) when as there ſhall any miſchiefe begin to ariſe, things will goe continually worſe and worſe, in ſuch fort, as they ſhall not be able to help it when they would. Now we neede not to go ſo farre as to publique perſons: but to come nearer vnto an houſholder that would ſet his houſe in good order; he ſhall haue theſe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alwaies with him: O, if I doe that which God hath ordained mee, ſuch a thing may fall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13060:141"/>out thus and thus. Or if a man ſhal trauell for the maintenance of his life, hee will conſider thus with him ſelfe: O, if I deale thus ſimply &amp; plainly, I ſhal be like a ſheepe in the iawes of wolues: for there are ſuch ſubtill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deuiſes in the world, that the wolues wil beguile me: euery man will ſeeke to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and intrap mee; and if I do not the like what ſhal become of me? Now, if I make my ſelf either an Eawe or a Weather, out of doubt they will eat the verie wooll off fro my back. Thus wee ſee What euery man thinketh, as if there were no prouidence of God at al. More ouer, if the matter ſhould come in queſtion for the giuing of our liues, although it be not at this day ſaid to euery one of vs, <hi>Take thy ſonne, yea thine onely ſonne Iſaak, and kill him;</hi> yet God commaundeth vs in generall to obey him, in confeſsing that he is our father and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt would haue vs to beare witneſſe of him,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.18</note> euen before the moſt peruerſe and cruel tyrants of the world: For he would not haue vs confeſſe him onely before ſuch as deſire to haue his kingdome come; but euen before his verie enimies, and before the greateſt perſecutors. Thus wee ſee what confeſsion hee requireth at our handes. Nay, but good ſyr; what will be the end of it? For thus you ſhall haue ſome fay: what good will my death do?</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:13060:142"/>
               <p>And if I ſhall put my ſelfe in daunger to be ſlaine, I ſhall be quite and cleane forgotten within three dayes after, and ſo therby breed offence to a great many others: For many wil ſay; he might haue eſcaped this wel inough if he had liſted: for we were quiet and all was well: we were not brought in queſtion about any thing: and now (forſooth) there muſt be a needeleſſe perſecution ſet abroch, and what good ſhall any man get by thruſting himſelfe in this manner ſo forward? Now ſurely theſe are verie friuolous allegations. For I pray you tell mee, had not God ſome meaning when as he both would and alſo commaunded vs to giue our ſelues in ſacrifice vnto his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie for the confeſsion of our faith; and make no reckning of our liues in regarde of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his moſt holye name? Did not hee right well knowe what would come of it? And ſhall wee thinke our ſelues wiſer &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpecter than he? VVherefore it is not without cauſe (as I haue alreadie ſaid) for vs to retaine this doctrine amongeſt the reſt, where it is ſaide, <hi>My ſonne, God will prouide a Sacrifice:</hi> For this is as much, as if the holie Ghoſt ſhould exhort vs, not to be ouerwiſe (as wee ſaye) in our owne conceites, and to be ouer-prouident to diſpute and ſaye; which way, I pray you, is it poſsible that this matter ſhould this come to paſſe? But let vs be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13060:142"/>contented, that ſith God hath ſpoken the worde, that he knoweth well inough howe to compaſſe it. And then let it goe as it will: for this is moſt ſure; that all ſhall go well, ſo long as he is our guide. And in the meane while, our wiſedome and reaſon muſt herein giue place; and wee muſt be wilfully blinde: to wite, wee muſt not be ſo ſharpe ſighted as theſe iolly wiſe worlings are, which will knowe all and iudge all; euen to the control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of whatſoeuer God ſhall doe. Neither let vs take from him that which is his: But let it ſuffice vs, that wee diſcharge our ſelues of our dueties.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee that wee can haue no faith except we ſet foorth the prouidence of God: and the meane to aduaunce and ſet it foorth, is, to put ouer vnto him all whatſoeuer that breedeth nothing elſe but doubtes, and ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs in manie perplexities. And to bee ſhort, that wee may ſaie: I beſeech thee O Lord, to guide mee whither it ſhall pleaſe thee: For, as for mee, I am but a poore blinde wretch, neither is it fit for mee to looke into this; for that will be, as it were, a bottomleſſe depth, to caſt my ſelfe downe headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when as I ſhall take in hand to direct my ſelfe, and to be mine own guide. Here we ſee what the true wiſedome is, which all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ought to haue: that is, not to be
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13060:143"/>ouer-wiſe, but to be contented with their meaſure: and when they ſee the way that is pointed out for them, to walke therein: and if they cannot come to the ende thereof at the firſt; yet let them not ceaſe to go on. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſee, as it were, mountaines to ſtay them, and the Sea to ſwallow them vp in: yet yet let them ouercome all this, and know that it was not written in vaine by the Pſalmiſt, where it is ſaide, <hi>That God hath commaunded his Angels to guide and direct vs, when as wee ſhall walke in our wayes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.11.12.</note> that is to ſay; that we decline not from that which he hath taught vs. But let vs know that he will alwaies finde out iſſues for thoſe things that ſhall grieue &amp; trouble vs, when as in our iudgement we ſhal ſee nothing elſe but confuſion and ſhame of face. Moreouer, here might, notwithſtanding be found ſome infirmitie in <hi>Abraham</hi> amidſt all his ſo excellent vertues, becauſe it ſeemeth that he diſſembled in ſaying, <hi>That he and his ſonne would come backe againe after they had worſhipped and ſacrificed in the Mountaine:</hi> For he did aſſure him ſelfe that his ſonne <hi>Iſaak</hi> muſt be ſlaine. Now it is not lawfull for vs in any wiſe to lye: And therefore it ſeemeth that <hi>Abraham</hi> in this point did amiſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome men doe iudge that he ſpake it by the ſpirite of Propheſie. But if it ſhould be ſo, then his faith was nothing; becauſe he muſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13060:143"/>needs then be ignorant of that which ſhould come to paſſe. For if God had reuealed vnto him that his ſonne ſhould eſcape; then could there be neither zeale ne yet conſtancie in him. But when as he imagined that there was no way with him, but to kill his ſonne; this ſhewed a teſtimonie of his obedience.</p>
               <p>VVhy then ſayd hee, <hi>That he and his ſonne would come backe againe?</hi> Let vs not thinke this to be any ſtrange manner of ſpeach: for when any of vs all is ſurpriſed and ouertaken with any vehement and grieuous paſsions, many vaine and fooliſh ſpeaches may ſo paſſe our lippes, as that wee may ſpeake wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what. And therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> might ſpeake like a man, as it were beſide him ſelfe: and yet not ſo, as if he knewe not what he had to doe? for, if he had obſtinatly done it, then had he not pleaſed God. But <hi>Abraham</hi> no doubt of it, had ſuch a ſtayed affection to do that which God commaunded him, as that he was (as a man would ſay) rauiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And this we ſee to be in all thoſe whom God hath ſtrengthned: As when a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to execution, he maketh no reckning of it: neither wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d he haue any man to diuert him from it: For he had thus made his account; I muſt nowe preſent my ſelfe before God, and therefore I muſt forget whatſoeuer elſe ſhall come in my minde.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:13060:144"/>
               <p>Thus then it fell out with our father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as that he did not diſtinctly thinke of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that he was to aunſwere vnto as concerning the ſacrifice: but ſaid onely, wee will go and ſacrifice vnto God, and when we haue made our oblation, we will come backe againe. And thus much as concerning this point.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is ſaide; <hi>That Abraham and his ſonne went farther togither.</hi> It is not without cauſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetteth downe theſe wordes twiſe, <hi>They went together:</hi> and after, <hi>They went on farther together.</hi> VVhen it is ſaid, <hi>That they went together,</hi> it is to let vs vnderſtand, in what a wonderfull paſsion <hi>Abraham</hi> was, when as he ſawe himſelf alone with his ſonne: For companie manie times withdraweth vs from being ſo troubled and grieued as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould be. For, when wee are alone by our ſelues, wee are then more penſiue and melancholie. Now <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw himſelfe to go with his ſonne, &amp; to conduct him: and alſo after he had ſo aunſwered him, yet to goe on with his ſonne: this doeth a great deale the more amplifie the ſtrength he had; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſo withdrawe him, as that he did not continually purſue his purpoſe, becauſe God guided him. VVherfore we ſee that he was ſtrengthened from aboue. For it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for him, as he was a man, to be able to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13060:144"/>ouercome theſe ſharpe temptations. And therefore God ſtrengthened him with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and an outſtretched arme. But that which is here ſet downe of him is written for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to the end wee might know, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Abraham</hi> was euen as weake a man as wee are, yet hee ſtill ſtroue and ouercame whatſoeuer was contrary vnto his faith, and that through the onely aſſiſtance of God. And although at this day we know our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yet let vs not as a great many doo, flatter and deceiue our ſelues therein: But it is the thing that ſhould the rather ſtirre vs vp and pricke vs forward to call vpon God, and looke for that at his hands, which is wanting in vs, and ſo perſeuer and continue, as that although the Diuell ſhall deuiſe euery manner of way to make vs grow diſſolute and goe backward, yet let vs continually goe on ſtill more and more a direct courſe. For, that which is heere ſaide of <hi>Three daies iourney,</hi> is to ſhew vnto vs that we muſt continue ſo long as it pleaſeth God. True it is, that we may for a while indure temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, perhaps a whole yeare; yea, tenne, peraduenture all the daies of our liues, and all this muſt be abidden. But here we are to note that <hi>Abraham</hi> was after another manner of ſort tempted, euen all his life long: For, after he had recouered his ſonne <hi>Iſaak,</hi> yet was hee not at reſt and quiet, but we ſee what terrible
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13060:145"/>conflicts he had in one only kind of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therefore let vs be ſtirred vp continually to pray to God from day to day, &amp; neuer ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer vvee are to note a thin vvhich is moſt manifeſtly ſeene, to wite, the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Iſaak:</hi> For it muſt needes be that hee vvoulde in very truth vvillingly and of his ovvne accord be ſacrificed, or at the leaſt had ſuch a loue to his father, as that hee vvoulde frame himſelfe to his vvill to be made a burnt offring vnto God. Heere vvee ſee vvhy it is namely ſaid, <hi>That they went together, and that Iſaak carried the wood.</hi> VVherefore let vs learne ſo to ſubmit our ſelues vnto the vvill of God, as that although wee muſt violently ſuppreſſe our paſſions and bring our ſelues vnder (as vvee haue already ſaide) yet let vs freely and of our own accord veeld our ſelues vnto him; For, all the faithfull muſt thus ſtriue and fight: to vvite, that although they ſuffer neuer ſo much ſorrow and griefe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God ſo liuely exerciſeth them as they be touched vvith ſome doubts and remorſe of conſcience, and be ſometimes as it vvere tired vvith their peruerſe and vvicked dealing with God: yet muſt they in the end conclude thus, euen to ſubmit and ſubiect themſelues vnto his vvill, and not ſuffer their contrary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo to hinder them from ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto him, but that they vvillingly and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13060:145"/>of their ovvne accord ſubmit themſelues vnto him both in life and death. An example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue in our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto <hi>Peter</hi> in this ſort:<note place="margin">Iohn, 21.18</note> 
                  <hi>When thou ſhalt be old</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>another ſhall carrie thee whither thou wouldeſt not.</hi> Now it is certain that S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffred for the Goſpel, hee went not to it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced &amp; grudgingly, but willingly &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offred himſelf a ſacrifice vnto God. And yet our Sauior Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that he ſhould be carried whither he would not.</hi> Thus vve ſee that there muſt be a double will in the faithful: &amp; yet ſuch as are not inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patible neither. For, of our owne nature we are continually moued, ſtubbornely to withſtande God. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> is a wicked will. VVherefore it muſt be tamed &amp; kept vnder, &amp; there muſt be another within vs that muſt correct that, &amp; muſt chooſe rather to die &amp; do Gods will, than to liue &amp; withall caſt off his yoke. This then we are to retaine from theſe words, <hi>That Iſaak &amp; his father went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; that they went on further together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God in acknowledging our ſins, and beſeech him ſo to touch vs, as that we may hate them, be rid of them, &amp; forſake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet ſo to ſupport vs in our weaknes, as that he will not but haue our ſeruice to pleaſe him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be vnperfect, &amp; that there are many things in vs which hee may find fault withall.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:13060:146"/>
               <p>And moreouer let vs learne ſo to bee led by him, as that we open not our eies wider than is lawfull for vs: But aſſure our ſelues that hee will alwaies grant a good iſſue vnto our waies, ſo that we looke no further but to goe whither ſoeuer hee ſhall commaund vs, and ſtill aime at that marke which he hath ſet before vs.</p>
               <p>That it would pleaſe him not onely, &amp;c.</p>
